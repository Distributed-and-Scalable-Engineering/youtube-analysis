0,kFMHx6XwBk0,"Very nice list! Here‚Äôs some things I would add as a native of the area:<br><br>This city is where the architects Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright got there start, you can find many works throughout the city<br><br>Don‚Äôt forget about the festivities! Lallapalooza and the taste of Chicago occur in the summer.<br><br>Chinatown is definitely a foodie adventure of its own<br><br>Chicago has a pretty impressive botanical garden on the far north side<br><br>Finally, Chicago is an amazing sports hub!

Use to growing up around country and farms and have only seen cities a handful of times from a distance. And to think 2 hours from me is this absolutely incredible metropolis that I&#39;ve never bothered to drive the short distance to. What a beautiful city, really.

4,kFMHx6XwBk0,I highly recommend skipping the Sky deck and it&#39;s astronomical prices and just go to the Signature Lounge on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Building. Entry is free and you can enjoy a delicious drink or tapas with the same beautiful views. Also I would suggest paying $10 a day per person for an all day pass on the Chicago water taxi. It&#39;s a great cruise that takes you from The Magnificent Mile to China Town. Much cheaper than the Chicago Architectural Cruise. Skip the deep dish pizza (we don&#39;t even eat that) and go to Home Run Inn pizza. It&#39;s the best you&#39;ll have around the Midwest.,302,21,Sarah

267,t_Pg-iXFvig,"People in Chicago often boast that it is the greatest city in the world, but it is all a matter of perspective in actuality. Chicago can be amazing if you&#39;re just visiting, but it can become rather boring if you&#39;re a resident. This will depend on what you consider fun. Museums are grand, and Chicago has brought house music to the world. The electronic music in a Chicago nightclub simply sounds better than in other international cities, but that is were it ends as far as nightlife is concerned. At the end of the day, it is the cliental that will make or break the nightlife experience. Chicago has a somewhat comprehensive public transport system when compared to other American cities; however, one must reside in the downtown area if they wish to remain car-free because all rail lines pass through or terminate there. Shanghai, in contrast, has line 4 which runs a large circular route in both directions as does the Ringbahn in Berlin. The Chicago Transit Authority had something similar planned called the circle line, but only a small portion of existing track was renovated thus far. The car culture is alive and well in Chicago thus the lack of investment and initiative in improving public transport. Chicago is nowhere near as dangerous as portrayed by the sensationalist news media. You must know where you are going, why you are going, and how to get there in advance to avoid looking like a chicken with its head cut off. Awareness of surroundings is very important.",1,0,Nathan Guadalupe

No mention of Chicago&#39;s world class universities. Chicago is actually a very clean and safe city for huge portion of it&#39;s urban area, 2nd only to NYC in the US. The North and Northwest urban cores of Chicago are very affluent, safe and vibrant as are many other portions of the city. The city is also very diverse beyond just white and black which this video fails to show. No mention of Chinatown, Little India, Boystown and all of the various other neighborhoods which showcase Chicago&#39;s diversity of people of all backgrounds. My reccomendation is to get out of the Loop....go up north to see the beautiful  Bahai House of Worship, go down south to Hyde Park and walk around the Garden of the Phoenix in the Historic Jackson Park. Get some thin crust at Phils for lunch and a meal at a Michilin starred establishment for fractions of the cost for a similar place than NYC. Take the Metra train to see a summer evening symphony concert at Ravinia. Bike the 606 trail and ride along the historic green boulevards. Visit the world class Chicago Botanic Garden and Morton Arboretum. Do the downtown tourist attractions, but please make time to go furhter out and you will be rewarded with a full picture of the city.

We would specifically be visiting U of Chicago &amp; Northwestern, while staying downtown. What would you recommend regarding driving near the city, turning in our rental car, using mass transit, and then getting a rental car for the trip home?

While there is plenty to do in the city, if you have time there is a whole lot to do outside city limits also. There are plenty of nice suburban towns with shopping and dining such as Naperville and Geneva. Also six flags in Gurnee is great for amusement park lovers. While much further away, Starved Rock state park is another great place to visit and hike (so is devils lake but that‚Äôs a little farther away and in Wisconsin. For zoo lovers visiting the Brookfield zoo is better than Lincoln park (IMHO) in Brookfield. But yes everything in the video I stand with 100 percent.

Do not come here, imagine 99 ants in a Nike shoe box and then they drop you in, you‚Äôre crashing into everyone with no room to spare. Living in Chicago or a big city like this is one of the most toxic things you can do to your life, these videos aren‚Äôt telling you the truth, many are paid to be here because Chicago lost residents due to over taxation, corruption from politicians, ultra, ultra violence from gangs and bad schools, the list goes on and on. You never ever want to move into this city, it‚Äôs over saturated with ppl living on top of each other, behind each other, every direction you go there‚Äôs 10 thousand ppl coming at you, there‚Äôs no room to breathe, the drivers are road rageful and wreckless and all you see are accidents everywhere. Chicago is a very very dangerous and TOXIC ENVIRONMENT, don‚Äôt come here or bring your family here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are beautiful ppl here but they are outnumbered by assholes and murderers. They have red light cameras everywhere to make money off the citizens because the politicians steal monies and the budget isn‚Äôt enough. My granny died here at 102, I learned from her this city has always been violent n corrupted and will always be. As a Blackman I‚Äôve been all over this country and to foreign countries, no place is this bad. I love all humans regardless of race or gender. If you just have to come to Illinois (which I hope u don‚Äôt) pleaseeeee avoid any interactions with the City of Chicago, move to a far off suburban area for the safety of u and you‚Äôre family.

1419,ueHJWaCQ0II,"It is not usually 43F in may lol, more like 50s-70s. Why do people get Chicago&#39;s weather so fucked up? Winters are not as cold as people say they are, and summers are hotter than the devil&#39;s asshole. The only saving grace is the Lake Effect cooling when the winds are prevailing off the lake, and only if you&#39;re somewhat close to the Lakeshore. Yes we do get a lot of snow. This is primarily because of the fact that we are very humid (relative humidity) year round AND have mild winters. Polar vortexes are NOT normal weather.. they drop temperatures down FAR below normal climactic averages, which is about 33F-ish daily high in January and 26F-low during the same time (e.g., the dead of winter. Yes, there is a thing called standard deviation. Yes, because of this, it can deviate up or down from 33/26F fairly substantially. So YES, a 14F night during january can happen, will do so semi regularly and is normal and our winters are still mild. If you&#39;re not convinced, go look at Minnesota, upper Wisconsin, most of Canada, the Northern Plains, Boston, Maine, Alaska, Iowa, etc. We sit on a front boundary AND directly beneath a jet stream flow. Our weather here can change on a dime which is what causes the whacky weather and also enables us to be &quot;warmer&quot; on average for our latitude. Bear in mind, that Chicago sits almost at the same latitude as the Mediterranean. Being warm is not something that is hard for our climate, rather that cold weather is a function of there not being any geographic barriers between the Arctic and here. Same goes for the Gulf air fronts. This is also what makes the central US so prime for Tornadoes. So yeah, can we please stop spreading this idea that Chicago is a frozen Tundra? Winter isn&#39;t even 6 months long like people say. Maybe some of late December, Jan, Feb, and the beginning of March, but the rest is totally livable; 3-3.5 months MAX, don&#39;t mistake spring and fall for winter that&#39;s dumb. Currently typing this as the last few days of May (and now June) have consistently been about 95F and so humid you can swim in the air. <br><br>FOR REFERENCE:<br><br>May-October pleasant to HOT, very humid <br>(Best time to visit) <br><br>November-December cool to cold, dry-ish<br>(Second best time to visit, especially for holidays) <br><br>January-February cold to COLD, snowy, icy <br>(Don&#39;t come, weather is bleh) <br><br>March-April variable, trending warmer but still cool to cold, very wet and rainy, sometimes it can snow (less likely) or freezing rain / sleet (more likely); severe weather season (e.g., Tornadoes, Derechoes, Severe Thunderstorms) starts now till August  <br>(You can visit as temps are ambient, but it&#39;s constantly cloudy and rainy and weather can be highly variable, even more than usual; this is the time of year where expressions like &quot;Chicago can experience all four seasons in one day&quot; are coined; also nothing really is going on in the spring from a tourism perspective so do with that what you will?)",0,0,Scenic Depictions of Chicago Life

1517,UT8SnicEct0,"Quick tip from a Chicago waitress: Take a minute to find the local diner/pancake house/family restaurant close to your hotel or your day&#39;s planned destination and go there for breakfast! Hotel breakfast is almost always either terrible or overly fussy and expensive. Chicago breakfast spots have really good food, usually huge menus most nowadays have vegan, gluten free and non dairy options as well. Also a great place to people watch take in local flavor and plan your day. Folks in Chicago tip well for good service (15-20%) and they expect it, so you&#39;ll prob get it. Talk to your server, they&#39;ll have great insider info for you on the neighborhood.",42,0,Nancy Moran
1518,UT8SnicEct0,"At one point, Chicago was considered the most culturally diverse culinary scene. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s still true, but we really do have everything.

1522,UT8SnicEct0,"Great post! You got everything just about right except 1. Locals do the touristy stuff too we just don&#39;t get distracted staring up at the buildings on our way from one attraction to the other and 2. There is more to Chicago than downtown and the suburbs! This is the city of neighborhoods! So if there are tourists like yourself who come here multiple times, do some research and go visit areas that are not near Michigan Avenue. We are culturally rich in heritages beyond mainstream consumerism and people not from here should visit other areas and meet real local, native Chicagoans",131,2,Kiki White

1526,UT8SnicEct0,Currently on the train coming home from Chicago. In the summer (I went near 4th of July) certain shops close later (10-11) and a lot of people are still out very late downtown. Another thing I would recommend is a City Pass. Not only do you get to go into both the Hancock and the Sears tower but when you go to Sears tower you get the ‚Äúexpress‚Äù option so you get to skip the line for the elevator and the ledge (the glass boxes). You also get some extra stuff at the aquarium and the museums. It‚Äôs definitely worth the investment especially if you plan on bringing the family. I actually recommend if you can don‚Äôt fly in instead take a train in. It‚Äôs super fun and the kids can see so many other places.,26,0,Vex
1527,UT8SnicEct0,"As an Evanston resident who loves Chicago, I have a couple more tips:<br><br>1. Don&#39;t skip Little Village or Pilsen (two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods on the city&#39;s west side). Along with some of the most authentic Mexican food in the country, Pilsen especially is known for its colorful murals and 26th Street in Little Village is known as &quot;Mexico of the Midwest.&quot; These neighborhoods are also great places to meet locals.<br><br>2. Also, don&#39;t be too scared when it comes to safety. Sure, Chicago has a lot of crimes committed, but it also has a population of 2 million people, plus several more million who live in the suburbs, so the crime isn&#39;t as bad as the media portrays it to be. Just use common sense, and don&#39;t be afraid to visit the city&#39;s south and west sides (the &quot;bad&quot; sides). Despite their reputation, there are many great places within these neighborhoods, and you&#39;ll definitely get more out of your trip than if you just stay in the touristy parts of the city.<br><br>3. Also, if you drive in, many of the CTA &quot;L&quot; lines have Park and Ride stations, where you can leave your car and take public transit downtown (or anywhere else you might be going).",89,14,Nick P
1528,UT8SnicEct0,"Don&#39;t be afraid to talk to random Chicagoans. Unlike in most big cities, most of us are accustomed to talking to strangers on trains, in the elevator, on the street, etc..

1530,UT8SnicEct0,"1. Architectural tours are a must. The boat ones are great, and the walking ones are amazing, too. There is everything from gorgeous art nouveau to skyscrapers taller than you can imagine. The interiors are often times the most breathtaking part.  <br>2. North Avenue beach (free), Lincoln Park Zoo (free), and the Botanical Gardens is an amazing day. No car. No bus. All walking distance from each other with a hypnotizing view of the city. When you are done, go for a walk in the neighborhoods. Safe, clean, and gorgeous. <br>3. Ask for help or directions or even recommendations from complete strangers. Yep. Chicagoans are helpful (as long as they aren‚Äôt on their way to work) and friendly. <br>4. Stay in the Magnificent Mile or Near North Side over the Loop. Things are open later and there is life after 7pm. <br>5.  Be prepared if you come in July, August, or September. Chicago is hot and humid.  90-100F and it feels like you are walking through soup. Closer to the lake is always better, cooler, and with a nice breeze. Well, almost always. <br>6. Winter? January and February are often when Chicagoans get excited for anything above 12F (don‚Äôt forget the wind chill). March is warmer but the wind is painful. <br>7. Workers in stores, tourist locations, really any customer service are not always as nice as the random person walking down the street. <br>8. There is more than just unhealthy food.

The summer is one of the better times to visit, especially when the Taste of Chicago is going on.  However, if one isn&#39;t a foodie, I&#39;d go in late September to early Oct which is when many of the movies are filmed.  An abbreviated list for those who didn&#39;t take notes - Museums: Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Art Institute.  Seasonal Sports: Cubs, White Sox, Bulls, Blackhawks.  Zoos: Lincoln Park and Brookfield.  Shopping is available up and down Michigan Avenue and on State Street at Macy&#39;s. Observatories: Sears Tower and John Handcock.  There are quite a few theaters from the larger Goodman to small ones but Second City is a popular attraction.  If one doesn&#39;t mind using public transportation and heading to the burbs, Ravinia in Highland Park has some nice concerns with lawn and pavilion seating.  There are nice bike trails that stretch from McCormick Place to the northern burbs along the lakefront.  There are also plenty of beaches but Oak Street is the most popular.  I recommend getting a Fodor&#39;s book.  Also, I don&#39;t recommend walking around the downtown area after 8:00 PM unless you&#39;re careful.

For the peeps staying in Airbnb‚Äôs instead of hotels, please be aware that in neighborhoods surrounding the downtown areas, I would definitely avoid being out and about on foot at night‚Äîeven in the popular, mostly young, gentrified neighborhoods that are on the north/south side of the city like Pilsen, Logan Square, Wicker Park, Lincoln Park, Lakeview, etc. (especially in the summer, as it can become a bit more dangerous) Uber/Lyft will be your best friends for getting around at night!<br><br>Also, CTA trains and buses will smell like pee‚Äîit‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôll get used to it.",9,4,chilaquiles

Just 3 blocks from the Union Stockyards in the same year that it finally closed after over 100 years. Why the jealousy? Maybe because nobody really knows about Naperville so it sounds cooler to be from Chicago. I get that, but at the same time how would he have liked to deal with the stench of Bubbly Creek walking to school with the wind blowing so hard that when it stopped, all the kids actually fell down?

1670,UT8SnicEct0,"As a Northside Chicagoan here are my tips:<br>1) Do be mindful of neighborhoods you go in to.  Even the Northside has some troublesome neighborhoods, but for the most part it&#39;s a great city.  <br>2) I&#39;ve never even been a fan of deep dish. I, like others have said, like the tavern style thin crust cut into squares.  Putting ketchup on a hotdog is a no-no but I think there&#39;s a lot who are closet ketchup users.  4)WE HAVE AMAZING TACOS EVERYWHERE.  <br>5) Parking does suck when visiting popular areas ie: Downtown/Wrigley Field(Lincoln Park).  But it&#39;s not impossible to drive around.<br>6) our suburbs can be nice spots to travel to ie Rosemont, Evanston in northside. Great America isn&#39;t in Chicago but you can get there in an hour<br>7) Summer in Chicago is great! Winter can suck, but it doesn&#39;t always stop having a good time out.<br>8) Don&#39;t talk crap about our sports teams, even if a certain team is sucking right now, unless you want to get in a fight.  If you&#39;re from Detroit you&#39;ll prob hear Detroit sucks at some point...nothing personal.  And Green and Gold are colors of evil in this city.  <br>9) Don&#39;t get in between Cubs vs White Sox you may inadvertently get hit by either side<br>10) Uber and Lyft is a Godsend.  CTA is cheap though and will get you everywhere.  It does get congested and some trains are just...yuck.<br>11) MICHAEL JORDAN IS THE GOAT NOT EVEN A QUESTION...<br>12) SEARS TOWER....who&#39;s this Willis guy?<br>13) Definitely don&#39;t call it Chiraq! <br>14) Enjoy yourself.

1682,UT8SnicEct0,"Chicago is a great and unique city. It is the largest city in the US that isn&#39;t along the coasts, and the 3rd largest overall. It is the huge, sprawling metropolis that is still very much a Midwestern city but also at the same time tries very hard to disassociate itself from the Midwest.  People there are still generally pretty friendly and sociable, just like you&#39;ll see throughout most of the Midwest. There is some great food in Chicago, but man it is hard to find a restaurant that uses locally or even regionally produced ingredients for example. <br><br>Chicago until recently was also a relatively affordable city especially compared to LA, NYC, etc... Increasingly, I&#39;d say that it is quickly becoming unafforadable as major corporations and tech companies continue to locate, re-locate, and expand in Chicago proper. Some of the burbs are still somewhat affordable. As a tourist, it is still a fairly affordable city. <br><br>Be prepared for some sticker shock at the museums.

But DON&#39;T eat there! You can find most of the same food within a mile of the Pier and for cheaper. Everything is hella marked up since most people don&#39;t think to eat ahead of time or don&#39;t want to leave to go eat, so customers shell out the extra cash and the restaurants (and the city) profits tremendously.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re going to get deep dish, only get it once. Otherwise, you&#39;ll get sick of it (and miss out on Chicago&#39;s other amazing food options).

1730,UT8SnicEct0,"A couple more points from someone who&#39;s lived in Chicago for like 15 years:<br><br>1. For city neighborhoods outside the loop, don&#39;t just go to Wrigleyville -  there are plenty of other fantastic neighborhoods for nightlife dining shopping etc: Logan Square, Wicker Park, Pilsen, Andersonville, Lincoln Square, pick a few of these and hang out each one has a unique vibe.<br>2. If you have to stay downtown the West Loop is better than River North for food - river north is over priced and gimicky, West Loop can be pricey but you get better bang for your buck at those restaurants, its got a bit more of a local flair to it instead of touristy.<br>3. Locals don&#39;t eat Deep Dish except for special occasions - try to find a good &quot;Tavern Style&quot; pizza place if you want the pizza that Chicagoans eat on a more regular basis, tends to be thin crust and cut into squares.   Also you can literally find almost every type of pizza in Chicago even some unique ones like Quad Cities style and one of the best pizza places here actually serves New Haven Style (and some fantastic beer too).<br>4. The Chicago accent is still alive!   Working class white Chicagoans on the south side and far northwest sides are where you are most likely to hear it (and plenty of places in the burbs too).   Even some younger people have it, though its usually softer (but not always).   Some Chicagoisms like Washroom instead of bathroom (Canadians: This is not normal in the states) are pretty commonly heard too.   I think you are less likely to hear it in downtown\Wrigleyville because there are so many transplants there.<br><br>5.

Most of the things that weren&#39;t right were already mentioned in the comments (such as Six Flags is nowhere near Chicago proper). Your idea of stretching out beyond the Loop is a great one. A visitor should research this stuff before travelling here. Outside of the &quot;BIG DOWNTOWN&quot;  loop area, there are numerous neighborhoods that boast their own unique character. To a visitor, it might be a less expensive, and a more relaxed  environment than the hustle and bustle of The Loop. Look up Andersonville, Lincoln Square, Roscoe Village.

1882,UT8SnicEct0,"From someone who lives in the suburbs but comes to Chicago often...<br>Nothing is open in downtown Chicago on weekends. Okay, a bit of an overreaction, but not a lot is open at night on the weekends bc as he said, it is primarily a business area.<br>Go to Broadway in Chicago, it is absolutely amazing, and much less expensive than Broadway in NYC. And it is right in the city, you can easily walk from downtown, and there are some really beautiful theaters.<br>Use the water taxi. It&#39;s fun. Along with the architectural tour, use the water taxi at least once to get around the city (if its the late spring, summer, or early fall), because its a really nice and fun way to get around the city. <br>The reason a lot of people from the suburbs say they&#39;re from Chicago (at least why I do sometimes) is generally for two reasons. One, is that a lot of people (like me), particularly younger people, were born there to parents who later moved out to the suburbs. And two, mainly this one, non-locals don&#39;t know where anything is. If you, a European presumably, asked me, from the suburbs, where I was from, I wouldn&#39;t say the name of my relatively small and unknown town, I&#39;d say Chicago. When talking to other people not from the Midwest, I&#39;d say Chicago, when talking to Midwesterners, I&#39;d say my actual town. Mainly just because its unnecessarily confusing otherwise. <br>And I know someone else said it, but DEFINITELY visit other neighborhoods of Chicago. Yes, check to make sure they are safe, but there is so much diversity in the neighborhoods, that you won&#39;t find in the suburbs that makes Chicago a great place to visit.<br>Don&#39;t use a car.

Just use public transportation, or walk.  <br>Also if you&#39;re spending more than a few days... six flags great america is amazing.",0,0,Melanie Kurtz

There are a lot of people around you and you never know who&#39;s watching. If you need time to look for something up on your phone, walk into a bank or a pharmacy like Walgreens or CVS but please don&#39;t stand in the middle of the entrance. When going on escalators you walk on the left and stand on the right, people are constantly on the move and if you block the entire escalator with yourself or your bags you will piss people off. When using the public transportation most likely you&#39;ll have to deal with Ventra, take note, this is a different entity from the CTA, if you have any problems with ventra and you ask CTA attendants about it it is very likely they will not want to deal with Ventra and will refer you to the Ventra customer service. I believe you can skip all of that and use your bank card, you will get a $5 fee every single time you use it but the charge won&#39;t stick, I forget what the process for it is but you will get the difference refunded to you eventually. Be aware that using your bank card, phone, or cash on the bus you will get charged 2.50 instead of 2.25 when using a ventra card.

I wouldn&#39;t go into Chicago for it. It&#39;s probably my favorite food in the world, but if someone told me the only way I can have it was by going into Chicago for it, I&#39;d just rather never eat it again. Chicago is that awful.

2864,zcb2Tmk0SL4,"My comments on Luis Gusto&#39;s tips (FWIW):<br><br>First, the vast majority of info in this seven-minute clip is &quot;spot on&quot;.  Specifically:<br><br>1. The downtown architectural tours given by the Chicago Architectural Society are a MUST, whether you take a walking tour or the boat tour. Highly recommended!!<br><br>2. Luis is correct in recommending that you avoid going to the observation deck of the Sears Tower.  The view from the Hancock Bldg. observation deck is far superior and there are no waiting lines.  Incidentally, this is also applicable to NYC .  Do not go to the top of the Empire State Building; instead, go to the top of the skyscraper at Rockefeller Center.<br><br>3. Deep dish pizza is truly awful and it is unrecognizable as pizza to anyone who knows what pizza really is.  Anyone from big cities on the East Coast, e.g., NYC, Philadelphia, Boston, will gag on this stuff and they do NOT make pizza like this in Italy.  Pizza should be THIN crust, baked deep in a brick oven to give the crust a crispy texture, and ingredients and toppings should be top quality, i.e., imported from Italy.  Period.<br><br>4. Navy Pier and the Mag Mile are both to be avoided and Luis is correct here.  They are both giant outdoor shopping malls with very little of interest.  A walk down the Mag Mile can be justifiable IF you do it to admire the Chicago architecture, but that&#39;s it!!<br><br>5. Strongly agree with Luis with regard to cuisine.  Absolutely no reason to go to a Starbucks or any of the chain restaurants when you are in Chicago, one of the top 3 foody cities in the United States (note: the other two are, of course, NYC and San Francisco).  Chicago has an endless variety of authentic ethnic restaurants including central and eastern European food that you may only find in 2 or 3 other U.S. cities.<br><br>6. Disagree with Luis with respect to Millennium Park.  Great place for people-watching and the Bean and the glass walls with ever-changing faces of native Chicagoans are both fun.   Perhaps best of all, the adjacent perennial gardens are well-maintained and beautiful, a welcome oasis and respite amidst the glass and concrete.",3,0,dlphc oracl

2931,zcb2Tmk0SL4,"Sears tower is a timed entry and it‚Äôs more than just the glass ledge they have redesigned the exhibit so you are walking thru the history of Chicago. Millennium park is more than the bean if you go in the summer sit and have a picnic and listen to the grant park symphony. It‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs in a beautiful Frank Gehry designed concert stage. It also connects by bridges to other parks and to the Art Institute. You can easily walk from there South or east to the lakefront , Buckingham fountain , or the gardens in Grant Park. Once on the lakefront or even in front of Millennium Park rent one of the city bikes ( I love the pedal assist ebikes ) and ride south along the lake as far as want . These are the best views of Chicago skyline, museum campus, and the lake. It‚Äôs less crowded than riding North where the popular beaches are. Yes avoid navy pier unless your taking one of the tour boats on the lake. The odyssey has a nice dinner cruise with dancing. I would not stay in Hyde park ( too far south and not on the CTA train lines or Chinatown (besides the restaurants not much to do but it does have a train stop) but focus on staying near wrigleyville, Logan Square, Wicker Park , or Near North. All these are a short train ride to downtown or the airport. Yes take the architectural foundation river tours! Go to Eater Chicago website and choose one of the iconic restaurants that they list. Yes do not eat at a chain restaurant if your coming here. Have a cocktail at one of the many rooftop bars. Chicago deep dish is ok you can go just to say you had it but only once (wink). Just my opinion after living here for 41 years. Obviously it‚Äôs huge city and everyone has there opinions but no matter what you‚Äôll have a fun time exploring.",0,0,James mosley

3116,Asw4NOHXBDQ,"As someone who‚Äôs from and even currently lives in the south side, I honestly must say the south side is not that bad. Bronzeville is actually thEE 2nd most historic African American neighborhood in the country after Harlem in New York. Chicago has the best food, and some of the most gorgeous architectural homes in the city. Englewood actually was at one time the busiest place in Chicago outside of the loop. The SEARS corporation had its flagship store in englewood right on 63rd and Halsted (I believe it was halsted). People should honestly come to the south side, it‚Äôs not that bad as the media portrays. There are areas that aren‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs not the most dangerous place in America, trust me. What can happen on the south side can happen anywhere in America and the world. Besides that, I think this guy did a great job showing the city, This is world class city, a welcoming city. Come visit and don‚Äôt be scared.",40,3,Shakir Adair

3119,Asw4NOHXBDQ,"I visited Chicago in 1991, and have always wanted to get back there. I loved it then. Such a beautiful and interesting city. I started in New York and worked my way west. The difference between the two was stark, maybe even more so back then; it was before Giuliani was mayor of New York and while I really loved it there too, it was not safe and the people whilst not rude, did not go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The people in Chicago though, were warm and friendly and even when I walked into a couple of bad neighbourhoods, I didn&#39;t feel like I was in danger or that I needed to get the hell out of there, like I did in New York&#39;s Harlem and Spanish Harlem.

3122,Asw4NOHXBDQ,Finally back to what you do best - showcasing a city with all its virtues and vices. Very informative and slick. Chicago lives up to its reputation of being the windy city with gusts which you can lean into if not get carried away. Outside of the cold months it&#39;s definitely a beautiful city with a lot of green spaces but also enough of concrete to give competition to the big Apple as far as construction goes. Thanks for a wonderful tour.,154,22,Rex T
3123,Asw4NOHXBDQ,Chicago is the best looking city in the üá∫üá∏. I visited there for the first time last year. I was shocked how clean it was. The architect of the building is unmatched. I felt right at home.,242,22,Ave T Vision

I&#39;m from South Texas and prefer the warmer weather. But this video gave me a good look at the city. I was surprised. I didn&#39;t realize how beautiful the place is, with great architecture and lots of things to do and see. It does look cleaner, safer and more manageable than New York. Chicago is still too big, too crowded and too cold for my taste, but I think it is underrated. All the movies seem to take place either in New York or LA. Yet, here is a city that offers the best of both cities.",3,0,Gilberto Dominguez

Although the downtown highlights were breathtaking...I wish you had touched up a little more on other diversified ethnicities and the areas for food, shopping, etc. like Devon for India, Greek town, China Town was touched on a bit, Hispanic areas. Also, some more recreational activities in the inner city. It would attract a lot more people of other ethnic backgrounds to see of their culture and take interest in tourism.

I volunteered at the Ukrainian National Museum back than. I still go there on and off to visit the museum and go to the Ukrainian restaurants. I love Tryzub as well and I love that they have a Ukrainian tryzub made out of kitchen utensils. I would also recommend that you checkout Old Lviv. Old Lviv is going to a Ukrainian families home and eating a home cooked meal. I feel so at home at Old Lviv. Also love that they have the buffet option so I get can my Ukrainian taste buds going without worrying about having to be picky about what to get. I can just get a bunch of different foods. Although they do charge separately for pierogie&#39;s there at Old Lviv, but they&#39;re so good!! Great video overall!

Its where the square slices come from. <br><br>One museum you didn&#39;t mention but I would definitely recommend is The Museum of Science &amp; Industry. Along with the Art Institute, it&#39;s one of my two favorites. I could talk about the Museum of Science &amp; Industry for hundreds of hours. The submarine, the train, the mine, the airplane, etc. (I was stoked to see you added the museum towards the end of the video! Nice!)<br><br>Also, I&#39;m obsessed with Frank Lloyd Wright and I&#39;ve seen every place he designed in this area. I highly recommend doing the same. <br><br>Go eat pizza at Art of Pizza and I was so happy to see you check out live music at The Green Mill! Its by far my fave. <br><br>I grew up 45min outside the city and my house was a mile from our Metra stop along Route 14. That Metra line intersected the Red (El) Line to Ohare Airport and also intersected the bus line to Wrigley Field. So I only had to walk (or ride my bike) a mile and I could go anywhere in the city or anywhere in the world. My Dad worked at United Airlines (hq is just outside the city) for 20+ yrs and I have flight benefits for life. <br><br>I have lived in Tahoe the past 18yrs but I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to spend my first 22yrs of life anywhere else.

In order for you to see the crime you have to be in those bad neighborhoods looking for trouble. Most likely you will only see or hear about it on the news. The weather is very bad in December - March sometimes in April. COLD. But if it wasnt from the weather I&#39;m gonna be honest Chicago is The best City in the US to live in. I moved to Houston because I gave Chicago 40 plus years of my life I&#39;m TIRED of the damn snow and cold. Lastly you missed a lot of the communties in Chicago like Pilsen, aka lil mexico, Greek town . The Polish community, Devon ave has a very Large Middle eastern communtiy Not to mention you also forgot The jewish community. Then you forgot the good Black commuity Hype park and The west side where The Chicago Bulls play which is also a good black community . But you would&#39;nt know because your not from Chicago.

You have the Loop and North Side correct, but what you listed as the West Side is the Northwest Side. And the Northwest Side is really a subset of the North Side. So on your map, what you have as North Side and West Side should have all been the North Side. Then what you have listed as the South Side, the western part of that is the West Side. Everything south of the Loop is the South Side. So basically, the sides are named according to their direction from the Loop - the North Side, the South Side, and the West Side. In addition, a guy towards the end of the video was implying that crime is not really citywide, it&#39;s just in certain areas of the West and South Sides. And not all the West and South Sides, just certain areas. But when you were doing your wrap up, you kind of disregarded that and mentioned crime as a con. Instead, you  should have stressed his point that crime does happen in certain parts of the city over and over but is not citywide in elevated numbers. Because of what anyone says, there is not high numbers of crime all around the city limits.",1,0,Tim Henderson

Though some places have closed since or before the pandemic. <br><br>Chicago also features certain restaurants you can&#39;t find anywhere else in the country. The majority of restaurants and places like museums, hotels are clean. Unlike, what I&#39;ve seen in the South where many restaurants don&#39;t seem very clean. Even in so-called, upscale restaurants along with some lack luster hotels compared to their same brand-named counterparts in the North. There are also plenty of schools, trade schools, colleges, and university, along with top sports teams like the Cubs and Bulls. <br><br>Btw, you won&#39;t see homeless people everywhere like in LA. In fact, you could go for a whole year or two without seeing one depending on your routine or areas you frequent in your daily life. Maybe it has to do with it being cold most of the year, lol. <br><br>All that said, except for few months of summer, the weather is so unstable and cold (and even worse for older people) along with the crime you keep hearing about (or may even experience) makes you wonder if it&#39;s worth it.",0,0,Sky Walker

Why here? - Chicago is the second largest &quot;Polish&quot; city (after Warsaw). In the so-called Greater Chicago is home to nearly one and a half million people of Polish descent. Because my profession is a professional sailor, I also sailed here on Lake Michigan, from here I set off on my sailing yacht to Poland in 1991 (after the fall of communism) to Poland. From Chicago, I also started my sailing journeys throughout the  Chicago River, Illinois and Mississippi Rivers to Caribbean. From Chicago I sailed the Great Lakes, the Erie Canal, and the Hudson River to New York and further in the world. To this day, I live in Chicago - it&#39;s my base.

Public transportation is fine, but depending on what lines you&#39;re taking, you might see some weird shit. Lots of homeless people. Good number of Crackheads. Usually, they won&#39;t bother you if you don&#39;t bother them. But occasionally they might do some weird shit like contorting their limbs like they&#39;re possessed or urinating in some shape or form. Dude&#39;s might be going from train car to train car selling bootleg stuff or loose cigarettes. Subways around downtown are cool, might catch some great musicians echoing through the tunnels.

3742,Asw4NOHXBDQ,"THE BIG QUESTIONS (PART 1 OF 3): WHO MADE US?<br>THE BIG QUESTIONS (PART 2 OF 3): THE PURPOSE OF LIFE...<br>THE BIG QUESTIONS (PART 3 OF 3): THE NEED FOR REVELATION...<br><br>At some point in our lives, everybody asks the big questions: ‚ÄúWho made us,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù<br><br>So who did make us?  Most of us have been brought up more on science than religion, and to believe in the Big Bang and evolution more than God.  But which makes more sense?  And is there any reason why the theories of science and creationism cannot coexist?<br><br>The Big Bang may explain the origin of the universe, but it doesn‚Äôt explain the origin of the primordial dust cloud.  This dust cloud (which, according to the theory, drew together, compacted and then exploded) had to come from somewhere.  After all, it contained enough matter to form not just our galaxy, but the billion other galaxies in the known universe.  So where did that come form?  Who, or what, created the primordial dust cloud?<br><br>Similarly, evolution may explain the fossil record, but it falls far short of explaining the quintessential essence of human life‚Äîthe soul.  We all have one.  We feel its presence, we speak of its existence and at times pray for its salvation.  But only the religious can explain where it came from.  The theory of natural selection can explain many of the material aspects of living things, but it fails to explain the human soul.<br><br>Furthermore, anyone who studies the complexities of life and the universe cannot help but witness the signature of the Creator.[1]  Whether or not people recognize these signs is another matter‚Äîas the old saying goes, denial isn‚Äôt just a river in Egypt.  (Get it? Denial, spelled ‚Äúde Nile‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the river Ni ‚Ä¶ oh, never mind.) The point is that if we see a painting, we know there is a painter.  If we see a sculpture, we know there‚Äôs a sculptor; a pot, a potter.  So when we view creation, shouldn‚Äôt we know there‚Äôs a Creator?<br><br>The concept that the universe exploded and then developed in balanced perfection through random events and natural selection is little different from the proposal that, by dropping bombs into a junkyard, sooner or later one of them will blow everything together into a perfect Mercedes.<br><br>If there is one thing we know for certain, it is that without a controlling influence, all systems degenerate into chaos.  The theories of the Big Bang and evolution propose the exact opposite, however‚Äîthat chaos fostered perfection.  Would it not be more reasonable to conclude that the Big Bang and evolution were controlled events? Controlled, that is, by the Creator?<br><br>The Bedouin of Arabia tell the tale of a nomad finding an exquisite palace at an oasis in the middle of an otherwise barren desert.  When he asks how it was built, the owner tells him it was formed by the forces of nature.  The wind shaped the rocks and blew them to the edge of this oasis, and then tumbled them together into the shape of the palace.  Then it blew sand and rain into the cracks to cement them together.  Next, it blew strands of sheep‚Äôs wool together into rugs and tapestries, stray wood together into furniture, doors, windowsills and trim, and positioned them in the palace at just the right locations.  Lightning strikes melted sand into sheets of glass and blasted them into the window-frames, and smelted black sand into steel and shaped it into the fence and gate with perfect alignment and symmetry.  The process took billions of years and only happened at this one place on earth‚Äîpurely through coincidence.<br><br>When we finish rolling our eyes, we get the point.  Obviously, the palace was built by design, not by happenstance.  To what (or more to the point, to Whom), then, should we attribute the origin of items of infinitely greater complexity, such as our universe and ourselves?<br><br>Another argument to dismiss the concept of Creationism focuses upon what people perceive to be the imperfections of creation.  These are the ‚ÄúHow can there be a God if such-and-such happened?‚Äù  arguments.  The issue under discussion could be anything from a natural disaster to birth defects, from genocide to grandma‚Äôs cancer.  That‚Äôs not the point.  The point is that denying God based upon what we perceive to be injustices of life presumes that a divine being would not have designed our lives to be anything other than perfect, and would have established justice on Earth.<br><br>Hmm ‚Ä¶ is there no other option?<br><br>We can just as easily propose that God did not design life on Earth to be paradise, but rather a test, the punishment or rewards of which are to be had in the next life, which is where God establishes His ultimate justice.  In support of this concept we can well ask who suffered more injustices in their worldly lives than God‚Äôs favorites, which is to say the prophets?  And who do we expect to occupy the highest stations in paradise, if not those who maintain true faith in the face of worldly adversity? So suffering in this worldly life does not necessarily translate into God‚Äôs disfavor, and a blissful worldly life does not necessarily translate into beatitude in the hereafter.<br><br>I would hope that, by this line of reasoning, we can agree upon the answer to the first ‚Äúbig question.‚Äù  Who made us? Can we agree that if we are creation, God is the Creator?<br><br>If we can‚Äôt agree on this point, there probably isn‚Äôt much point in continuing.  However, for those who do agree, let‚Äôs move on to ‚Äúbig question‚Äù number two‚Äîwhy are we here? What, in other words, is the purpose of life?<br><br><br>Copyright ¬© 2007 Dr.  Laurence B.

No mention of the historic racial and cultural diversity of Chicago in spite of white institutional racism that remains active in the city. Not just Chinese, but AfricanAmerican, African immigrants, &amp; mestizo-Mexican communities etc. The African American businesses, churches, salons, museums, etc that have thrived in-spite of the condescending nature of non-Black Americans, segregation of opportunity, &amp; its results on crime. Uncle Remus, Harold‚Äôs Chicken, Churches Chicken, Chicago‚Äôs Home of Chicken &amp; Waffles, Djenne Collection, Kayra Imports, Macarthur&#39;s, J&amp;J Fish, DuSable Museum of African American History, the African civilizations section of The Felid Museum (&amp; traditional African art at the Art Institute), the harold washington library, etc. The narrator is ignorant, like to many native Chicagoans, immigrants &amp; tourists. Many if not most non-AA Chicagoans are racist, misogynistic or prejudice towards AA, but many more are simply uneducated or ignorant, which only helps the systemic disparities all the same. Some of those areas are dangerous and it‚Äôs mostly due to the consequences of segregation, but that fear keeps additional revenue out of these businesses and shops within these communities, which continues the cycle. And as a Chicagoan &amp; a suburban native, as an African-American who was born in Illinois, I don‚Äôt stay out of those areas I‚Äôm just aware. This narrator was very ignorant. In spite of the ‚Äúmodel minority‚Äù pursuit put upon Eastern European immigrants, Asian immigrants, etc within North American racial-hierarchy, historically non-WASP would not be able to immigrate here without African Americans. I hope someone can look into the elements of Chicago, with more respect.",1,0,Afrinaut

Maybe it&#39;s only popular in some parts of the city? One thing you will find out about Chicago is that because of the neighborhoods, one section of the city might be completely different from another side. The south side is not like the north side, the east side is not like the west side, etc. Some of the rules also don&#39;t always apply. Parking is pretty easy and pretty much always free on my side of town, but north side is a nightmare to find parking lol.

I recommend China Town and Little Village, China town is always so cool a little small and crowded but has some great shops, and as a Mexican little village is my home away from home. There is a Latin American art museum great food places a park near by as well. And architecture is literally everywhere I recommend looking up churches and walking on the streets of the north side.

Explore University of Chicago campus. <br>3. Pullman National Monument. (Phase 1 complete, phase 2 u/c).<br>4. The food scene. China Town for real Chinese, Pilsen for authentic Mexican, Bronzeville for hip Black culture. (So many places to explore in the city)<br>5. Hard Rock Casino (Yes, It‚Äôs Gary Indiana, but right off the expressway and only 30 minute drive from Chicago and very impressive for MJ and Jackson 5 fans, plus live performances.)<br>6. Maggie Daley Park. It‚Äôs right next to Grant and Millennium Park and I believe the best park in the city. <br>Honorary mentions: <br>1. Although it‚Äôs not open yet, Obama Presidential Library and Museum is u/c done by 2025) <br>2. A casino within city limits is coming (done by 2025)<br>3.

Try Mr. Beef and other places.  Also, I know people say deep dish pizza is Chicago.  But, I can guarantee real Chicagoans think thin crust pizza is Chicago&#39;s pizza.  Not deep dish. Deep dish is for the tourists.  Go to a different pizza place and order the thin crust.  You will see the difference!<br>Also, glad you did the architectural tour.  You learn a lot. Try a Maxwell Street polish or Chicago hot dog.  Get an Italian sub and Italian ice in Little Italy.

7483,EsJSSZL-XPI,"Nice video of you in Chicago, I love my hometown as do many others! Sorry you personally didn&#39;t like the italian beef from Portillo&#39;s, the old saying &quot;everything is not for everybody&quot; rings true. Maybe for a 1st timer you may have bypassed having it &#39;dipped&#39;....  one thing for sure is the seasoning and tenderness of it, is there. Another person in the comments mentioned most natives often have other places we go for our italian beef, true, but many will do Portillo&#39;s too, it&#39;s so funny you are the first I&#39;ve ever heard to say it was terrible. I&#39;ve lived in 5 states, and everyone that has come home with me and tried them never called it terrible.  Hope you discover something else good for your taste buds, next time.",1,0,Dee

Johnnie&#39;s on North Ave in Elmwood Park has good beef, they look like a hole in the wall and only take cash. You also should get it with hot peppers (giardinara), not sweet peppers. People swear by Portillo&#39;s (including my brother!), but I never got the hype either. People also say Al&#39;s is good. I never had them.<br><br>For deep dish pizza, I prefer Uno or Due over Gino&#39;s East. For thin crust pizza, I like Home Run Inn.<br>For hot dogs, again, you got to come into the hood! I like Jimmy&#39;s Red Hots, again, the restaurant looks dinky and they only take cash. Their hot dogs and polishes are good and come wrapped with hand cut fries.<br><br><br>Another institution, Eli&#39;s Cheesecake used to have a restaurant downtown, but it&#39;s closed, so you have to come out to the Northwest side of the city to visit their store.

Lincoln Park (Nice Park with a rich History , a large lagoon and the free forever Lincoln Park Zoo)<br><br>3.Bloomingdale Trail aka The 606( a train track turned into a Park. A great way to explore our neighborhoods like Wicker Park and Humboldt) <br><br>4.North Shore Branch Trail( A nice trail and forest reserve that runs from Chicago to Chicago Botanic Gardens. Try Superdawg along the way )<br><br>5.North Shore Channel Trail ( Different from the North Branch and part a sculpture park and bike/runner friendly trail that runs from Chicago‚Äôs North Park neighborhood to Evanston.

9463,vnias1yIyOQ,"Lived here all my life over 40 years. It is a wonderful place to live if they did not have high taxes on everything and traffic cameras everywhere and parking tickets everyday. You have to make sure you move into an area were there is free parking, not north side of  Chicago parking is hideous and rent up north is ridiculous. I live southeast but southwest of Chicago is just as good, plenty of free parking and rent is a lot cheaper. I say southeast because at least you get to see and smell the Lake Michigan which is worth it. I live southeast less than one block from the lake great view, two buses stop right in front of my building that goes straight to downtown. And do not listen to people talking about you do not want to live in that area it is high crime, trust me crime is everywhere in Chicago. I lived in my current area for over 16 years never been robbed. Get off my bus and right at home. People in my building who do not have a car Uber to stores back and froth no problem, if you want to go party at night you can like I said there is buses that runs 24/7 from downtown going southeast and southwest.

Try Mr. Beef and other places.  Also, I know people say deep dish pizza is Chicago.  But, I can guarantee real Chicagoans think thin crust pizza is Chicago&#39;s pizza.  Not deep dish. Deep dish is for the tourists.  Go to a different pizza place and order the thin crust.  You will see the difference!<br>Also, glad you did the architectural tour.  You learn a lot. Try a Maxwell Street polish or Chicago hot dog.  Get an Italian sub and Italian ice in Little Italy.

Greek Americans also own a lot of food and restaurant supply businesses.

Try Superdawg along the way )<br><br>5.North Shore Channel Trail ( Different from the North Branch and part a sculpture park and bike/runner friendly trail that runs from Chicago‚Äôs North Park neighborhood to Evanston.

10193,s7GeyKXcUxg,"Good tips.  We were just in Chicago.  It seems like Lyft and Uber prices were really high.  We took an Uber from the Hancock tower down to the Chicago river and it was 12 bucks(for about 1 1/2 ride). It will take you more time but the L is an affordable way to get to either airport.  If you&#39;re going from downtown the Red Line is the way to get to Wrigley.  Still if we had to do it again I think we would ride a Divvy bike to the Wrigely from downtown.  One thing about the L is I thought it wasn&#39;t the nicest subway compared to NYC, Atlanta, London, or Paris.  Downtown Chicago is very walkable too.",0,0,vista7

10239,s7GeyKXcUxg,"#1. Train is fastest. More on time. But beware of poop cars and homeless.<br>#2. Buses cover more grounds. Safer. But buses are never on time, and slow. Take advantage of the Express routes!<br>#3. Water Taxis/Divvy Bikes. These are over priced and limited. But excellent for a cheap/free tourist experience.<br>#4. Uber/Lyft. If money isnt an issue, these are the way to go, if you aren&#39;t driving.<br>#5. Walking around is a great idea.<br><br>PS. No matter what, don&#39;t compare out public transportations to Asia&#39;s. Fares are not subsidized by our government. Many of our infrastructure is outdated. Most riders are middle-lower class riders. Expensive, old, un posh rides, so don&#39;t be culture shocked, please.",17,4,Enoch Clark Zhao

So if the Man said Sox&#39;s are the greatest gift you got him. Just know he saying it&#39;s the little things he value most. You care enough to do for him now it doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t. Value all the expensive thing&#39;s you buy him he do but what you got understand. Is Men who really don&#39;t require you spending on them. At a high cost is really just happy being with there gift given by Jehovah. Which happens to be your Corey gift from God. And he knows it so if the Man say Sox&#39;s made him happy from you. Sox&#39;s made him happy from you most women in today&#39;s world want. Even by you that for a birthday peace,1,0,Thomas Mcclendon

Don&#39;t get me wrong - Summer is great and all  - but there is really something special about fresh/deep snow covering both the ground and the trees under a brilliant blue sky....and even though the late start was probably inconvenient for everyone - you really can&#39;t beat those views that would normally have been hidden in the dark (also loved the scenes you captured of wildlife near the tracks!).,3,0,DC950

11454,teN-Y1wAu78,"Excellent video, both due to the amazing scenery and due to the fun-loving personalities and banter of our hosts, Jeb and Suzanne. My wife and I took the Empire Builder from Chicago to Seattle in May, 2022, so what you saw during the day we missed because it was night time. Seeing the eagles and deer was one highlight of your video for me. I agree that the steak (I got mine medium-rare) is the best tasting food option.¬†<br><br>By the way, Federal Law requires the freight companies to give priority to passenger trains using their tracks. Unfortunately, the freight companies ignore the law and so far no government agency has been holding them accountable. So Amtrak trains waiting on freight trains to pass, instead of the other way around, is one of the primary reasons Amtrak trains run late. In winter, 2023, the massive snow fall caused all kinds of havoc to the Empire Builder (E.B.), which is a seasonal reason that E.B. trains ran late and had full-blown cancelled trains.

11565,teN-Y1wAu78,Great vid as always. My fiance and I did exactly the same trip (even carrying on to Washington DC) exactly a year ago for my 47th Birthday. We had paid for a special cheap deal in Coach but paid to upgrade to a Roomette at Seattle Station. I swear they were all sold out as we ended up in a roomette in the staff car with no other passengers! We too were delayed but also appreciated the fact we got to see some great scenery during daylight hours. Did you see the Izaac Walton Inn near Glacier National Park? Our train kept breaking down from the start so ended up having a freight loco pull us. We ended up in Chicago over seven hours late so also had the extra meal on Amtrak EB then as we had missed our connecting train Amtrak put us up in the Swissotel in Chicago for the night which was lovely. They then gave us access to the Metropolitan Lounge the next morning even though we were riding Coach to Washington (that was quite an eventful ride with Police boarding the train in the night to make an arrest!). Being from England it takes a while for us to get out to the US but we love riding the trains and have been lucky enough to do most of the long distance routes.

11588,teN-Y1wAu78,Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us. Your videos and others on YouTube convinced us to book our first trip on Amtrak. In late August we are flying to Seattle and then taking the train (bedroom) to Sacramento. We will then spend two days to allow for any delays before getting on another train (bedroom) to Chicago.

11617,teN-Y1wAu78,"I rode Amtrak in 2005 - Kirkwood, MO to Fostoria, OH (now closed) through chicago. It was 2-3 hours late, supposed to be an hour to an hour and half layover in St. Louis, but the train stopped in STL for 5-10 minutes in order to go to chicago for other connections. Good thing I stayed on the train bec I knew that long layover wont happen due to extreme tardiness. I dont mind, good thing I made it to my connection to Fostoria. I think like 45 mins to an hour layover in chicago.  These guys in chicago helped me because I am deaf and they got me onto their cart to go on plateform, since I had a ticket for ecomany coach, they instead put me on business class coach. Dangerously friendly employees there. Arrived in Fostoria at 3 am, then a year later the fostoria station shutted down for good.  If I was on your route from Spokane to Cleveland, I would probably be very sick because I would start coughing before departure due to Spokane air making me cough real bad.  Good thing I took greyhound bus and in that case I was little sick, not cough much until I got home in cleveland, then I became more sick.  Never never again touch Spokane because of my two strikes.

11623,teN-Y1wAu78,"One of the questions was is a roomette worth it?  I have done the roundtrip in a roomette from Chicago on the zephyr to west coast and empire builder back to Chicago. I will say yes, the roomette is well worth the expense if your budget can support it. When you are on that train for that long, there are times when you want a place to go to have some personal space and privacy. Having your own bedroom also makes a world of difference as well. It would not be any fun trying to sleep in a coach seat night after night. I would like to offer some advice to anyone who might be curious about booking an amtrack trip. You need to realize that this is not going to be luxury travel, these trains bounce, sway and rock and can tussle you about pretty good at times. Bathrooms are very small and cramped. A Shower is available, but you find it more manageable to forgo the usual daily shower like you do at home.  I also met a few people on my journey who said they never had motion sickness from traveling in a car but experienced it on the train. The nearest thing I can compare it to is it is kind of like glamping. You do experience some level of luxuries but at the same time you have to be ready and prepared to deal with some inconveniences. If you look at it as an adventure and not a luxury vacation, you should enjoy. As for myself I loved every minute of my journey.",0,0,Thomas Neal

I woke up that morning to Arizona desert views which is basically brown sandyland with no greenery until the mountains which are hundreds of miles away it seemed. I never went into any mountains and once I entered West TX I was very sorry to look out the window and see more desert, real desert. Food brought to my room or obtained in the dining car  is wonderful the highlight of the trip. I once went to the viewing car and saw more desert as well as met some of the most boring people can imagine. I dreamed of beautiful views and all I saw was the junkyards of small town America where are the worst stuff is dumped down by the railroad. I dreamed of these remarkable conversations with interesting travelers and mat instead trumpeteers.   I got to see the behind views of Fort Worth and Dallas --not at all worth the trip and certainly not worth stopping and watching the freight train come past.   The one highlight we&#39;re a couple of beautiful old southern homes along the gulf in Mississippi. Then things took another downturn in the Panhandle of Florida.

There are two parts to the ultimate cost to the passenger(s), the rail fare and the accommodation charge. The rail fare is the cost of the transportation, what most people would refer to as the ticket price. That fare is per person. The accommodation charge is what you pay to upgrade from a coach seat to have a sleeping room and includes all dining car meals. That amount varies with the size of the room, but it&#39;s the same whether only one person uses it or four, which is the family room, Amtrak&#39;s largest. Adding a second person raises the total cost for a couple to travel, that&#39;s due to the cost of the second person&#39;s ticket.

I stumbled upon your channel merely looking for the Winnebago travel trailer review (which was great itself), but I am really amazed (again) at how good you are with these videos!  The cinematography is excellent. The editing is excellent.  The choice (and volume) of background music is excellent.  The subject matter is excellent and well-chosen.  You have me wanting to plan a similar trip, now.  Also, your narration is excellent!  Not only do you have a great voice for narration, but you do a good job of giving a little bit (not too much) of history/background of the things you are filming.  Gee, I&#39;m impressed.  There are so many garbage Youtube travel channels, but you are amongst the top!  I also like the links to the places you ate and tours you took, in the notes.  Bravo!  19,209 subscribers as I write this, but I see a whole lot more in your future!  :)",14,2,James Wood

Sticking to the tourist sites is always best (I think in any city). I like your vlog because I got to see it from a tourist perspective; I guess when we travel things seem to look a different way; it is only when we live in the actual place that our feelings may change.

13490,j9ptMwKAaGI,"Lower Wacker Drive was a crazy place in the 80s. Think Taxi Driver. Was a world all to itself, and not a pretty one. People might remember it from the car chase scene in one of the recent Batman movies. I think they also showed parts of the Pedway. That&#39;s an underground pedestrian walkway filled with shops that spans 40 blocks of the loop. Another underground universe unto itself that used to be sketchy back in the 80s, but really unique. Chicago and NYC have cleaned up quite a bit from those days and while safer, they are also less &quot;alive&quot; in a sense. These cities used to buzz with life. I really think Chicago is the most American of cities. It&#39;s a shame people from other countries, or even our own, dont visit it more. But I will admit it is a much better city to live in because it has so many layers you just keep discovering, even after 36 years.

13794,KTidbDz4xrk,"Especially in a roomette, it is a good idea to learn the dimensions of where you can put luggage and take things that will fit or can be squashed to fit (like a duffel bag for under a seat).  A little planning means you can have plenty of space for you.  You will notice that some, who didn&#39;t plan so carefully, seem to be living in an annoying pile of clutter.  It doesn&#39;t have to be that way.  For example, for a Superliner roomette, I found that a medium size roll-along type suit case sat vertically very nice on the broad step to the upper berth.  And a sports duffel bag squashed nicely to fit under a seat after taking out a few things and hanging them up (only about 8 inches depth under the seats, but extremely deep).  I could slide things like a computer and other objects under the other seat when not using them.  NOTHING cluttering up the space.  Of course, they have general storage down below for luggage, but not everyone will feel that approach is very secure.",13,2,Charles Kinzer

I have a friend who lives in NYC who sent me phone camera photos, but this is the first video I&#39;ve seen that really gives a nice look at the whole facility in some detail.  All of my Amtrak travel to date has been on western US routes, but the Lakeshore, Cardinal, Crescent and Capital Limited, are all on my Amtrak bucket list.  I agree that the roomette (Superliner is a little different but not that much) is plenty of room when travelling solo, the only way I&#39;ve experienced it.  I&#39;m not small so I don&#39;t think I could share one.  Overall, my feeling is as you say, the experience rather than the convenience is what I love about Amtrak travel.  Regardless of laws, freight trains rarely if ever yield precedence to Amtrak trains, so you can count on being late, it&#39;s just a question of how late.  There are also occasional mechanical problems and accidents that cause delays.  In a nutshell, you NEVER want to assume Amtrak will arrive on time; allow, if possible, a day of flexibility for connections, appointments, meetings, etc.  Thanks again, really enjoyed the video!",2,0,Harry Borsalino

13831,KTidbDz4xrk,"Good review from a &quot;out of town travelers&quot; perspective. The thing that really throws off any &quot;timetable&quot; in US train travel is, Amtrak leases-shares much of its route with freight train traffic, which has priority most times, and freight isn&#39;t on a tight  &quot;a to b&quot; schedule, so, that can be a huge variable. Also, delays come from things like bomb threats&quot; that get called in, as this actually happened to our Southwest Chief train on my return trip from California to Chicago in Feb 2020. Someone called in a bomb threat on the train, and when we reached Albuquerque NM, we had to de-board the train and wait about 2 hours while the local police searched the train for any explosive devices. Luckily, there was a good restaurant / bar within close walking distance and a few of us took advantage of a less expensive &quot;adult beverage drink service&quot; before we returned to the train. The train made up most of it&#39;s delay by the time we got to Chicago, but you need to keep in mind there are dozens of reasons you may experience a delay, and be flexible enough to not have one cripple the rest of your travel plans.",3,0,Internutt 1960

I do hope you had the staff write it up. ¬†<br><br>As for pricing, compared class to class they are surprisingly about the same.  Coach on Amtrak for that entire trip in June is about $315 while a bedroom will run $950 to $2000.  On a major national carrier it is $200-$500 for coach and around $2600 for first.

There is no rail service running from Burlington VT to Boston that doesn‚Äôt involve a side trip to Albany. When there was, the train still bypassed Concord and Manchester NH! (Two of NH‚Äôs biggest cities) In order to get to these two cities you must take a train to Boston and then get on a bus! A BUS to go to Manchester!

14130,KTidbDz4xrk,"While the run up to Albany has pleasant enough scenery, from there to Chicago it&#39;s depressing at best. Compared to Europe and elsewhere in the world, the station platforms are like dungeons. The train speeds, apart from trip times and chronic lateness, are decades out of date, again when compared to Europe. Don&#39;t know what you found charming about the dining car. Both the decor and the food had the look of a fast-food outlet. Seemingly, the U.S. traded high-quality train travel for the &quot;pleasure&quot; of everyone controlling their own vehicle on high-speed interstate highways‚Äîand it shows. FWIW, my own experience of American train travel many decades ago was exciting, interesting because of the contact between passengers, comfortable and relaxing, and at least equal in travel time to other modes of traffic. Driving across country versus taking the train in the early 1950s, both of which I did, there was no comparison. Seems to me, the truly unfortunate part of the American story of travel by train is that it&#39;s sad state isn&#39;t the result of an outdated form of travel technology, but an abandonment of the basic means of rail transportation, ostensibly because of our much greater travel distances than Europe and now the prohibitive cost and obstacles to building high-speed rail which, China, another country with a huge land mass, has covered with tens of thousands of miles of high-speed rail service.

There&#39;s a short ferry ride too. the island is so small that only emergency vehicles are allowed. to get places on the island you either have to take a horse drawn carriage or ride a bike. there&#39;s also a super fancy hotel on the island as well. the island&#39;s specialty is fudge! there are a few shops that sell it on the island and there&#39;s a big debate amongst michiganders about which is better, ryba&#39;s or murdick&#39;s fudge.

14596,mbtABJ5FfBc,"I have always been fascinated by Amtrak as a foreigner. The quality of the service for the price is certainly incommensurable and unfair compared to Japan, but the distances are real in US, not like Japan. And the service has a totally different concept behind: in foreign country we do not have (never had) the habit of enjoying a traveling experience like an hotel or spa. It is just an hassle to overcome in the less burdening way possible. The carriages also are old with a design that reflects bigger people, with different daily priorities (I believe it is also more costly to service and maintain than modern Japanese trains). But I think it has its fascination. If I was the company CEO, I would try to do some investments and try to refurbishing it, making it more touristic for that price. And certainly I would start from the menu and the restaurant cars. Americans usually are social: a more cosy space would certainly be enjoyable and attractive. The meals did not look that inviting, considering the price! There is a far better video on YT showing a long trip on Amtrak, introducing to all its details. it is a more sociable and enjoyable traveling tool than here presented in this solipsistic otaku dimension (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-RcNp1uhKE)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-RcNp1uhKE)</a>.

So if you travel car you have to pay for hotels, food, gas and tools if that applies .  Fuel would cost about $150.00 .<br>Also factor in the price  of wear and tear on your car  - probably 30 cents a mile. Also one doesn&#39;t have the stress and fatigue of driving a car 1,000 miles, checking into hotels, finding food to eat. hotel is easily $125.00 per night.  To drive a car 1,000  miles in two days is  difficult at best.  When you get to your destination you are tired. Meals for two can cost $25.00 to  $35.00 . So do the math !

14878,mbtABJ5FfBc,"Unfortunately, Americans don&#39;t embrace train travel like citizens in other countries. U.S. passenger trains were popular until after WWII. Railroads tried to lure passengers towards their long distance trains while losing money, so they&#39;ve concentrated on carrying freight instead as their cash cow until Amtrak took over. Interstate highways were built &amp; many families could afford cars for road trips offering more flexibility than trains. Soon after, air travel was becoming more affordable for travelers who needed to get to their destinations quickly. The continental U.S. is huge &amp; it takes approx. 3 days to get from coast to coast by train. Other countries are much smaller in area &amp; it&#39;s possible to get from coast to coast in 10 hours by train. I don&#39;t foresee a luxury high speed long distance rail system in the U.S. anytime soon. The only high speed U.S. train, The Acela on the East Coast, carries the most riders between Boston &amp; Wash. D.C. &amp; Amtrak owns this trackage with a record of being on time.

In the US‚Ä¶. rail travel is an afterthought‚Ä¶. receives no great attention‚Ä¶ is not valued when compared to air travel. The US rail network has to cover far greater distances with far fewer passengers. So guess what all this adds up to. It adds up to the fact that you can‚Äôt compare apples and oranges.
