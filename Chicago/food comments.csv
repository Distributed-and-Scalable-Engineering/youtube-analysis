1,mYCXmqEdevo,"As a born &amp; raised Chicagoan for over 70 years, I would like to offer kudos on your review of iconic Chicago food places. I&#39;ve eaten all the foods mentioned and have my own favorites,  but you did a wonderful job of identifying many of the foods Chicagoans really enjoy. Your passion for the windy city comes through on your videos, keep up the great job!",135,1,Bruno D
2,mYCXmqEdevo,"As a native of the windy city, You can never go wrong with Chicago Mexican food and the Italian beef. Would definitely love to see a pt. 2!",36,0,Hueso
3,mYCXmqEdevo,"I love that you guys mentioned that we chicagoans eat tavern style more often. Every time I go somewhere, people say that deep dish is too think etc. And praise NYC pizza, but I‚Äôm like honestly we don‚Äôt eat that too often. The tavern thin crust is our favorite. Deep dish is just a comercialized staple to be different and rival NYC.",51,0,Gen Wilson
4,mYCXmqEdevo,As a lifelong Chicagoan.  This list is absolutely on point.  It&#39;s a prefect run down of all the places we love.,27,1,Beau Artson
5,mYCXmqEdevo,"So glad you called out Tavern style as the &quot;Daily Driver Pizza&quot; of Chicagoans. As a style, it has not gotten the love it deserves. Side note: if you are getting a deep dish/stuffed pizza, combine some genres. Top it with Italian beef and Hot Peppers. It&#39;s basically a beef inside of a deep dish. Underrated approach.",38,1,Timothy Soen
6,mYCXmqEdevo,"As a native Chicagoan, I stumbled upon your videos recently. I am so impressed with your knowledge of the city. You‚Äôre a good resource.",16,0,bigmusclebeef
7,mYCXmqEdevo,"Great piece. Would love to see part 2. Mother-in-law, Rainbow cone, Italian lemonade, shrimp dejhonge, saganaki, etc. BTW, everyone I know believes that the meat topping of choice on a pizza is always sausage, not pepperoni.",24,1,Robert Kumaki
8,mYCXmqEdevo,"I wanted to say thank you for all your videos. I&#39;m a Chicagoan, but I&#39;m embarrassed to say I don&#39;t know much when it comes to eating out. I don&#39;t make much money so I cook more at home. I&#39;m definitely trying out these places in the future! Thanks again!",30,2,NtateNarin

10,mYCXmqEdevo,"Hey Luis, I really appreciate your videos.  My wife and I just took a long weekend to Chicago (four nights) and I probably watched a dozen of your videos beforehand and definitely got some help.  From using public transportation easier to enjoying some local restaurants, you helped us get a lot more out of our vacation.  We stayed in an Air B&amp;B in Little Italy and we went to Conte di Sovia, Jim‚Äôs Original, Ann Sather, Little Branch Cafe, and Mr. Beef - all of which we would not have known about if not for your videos.  Thanks for the solid information and recommendations!",1,0,John Landeck
11,mYCXmqEdevo,You need to include the porkchop sandwich from Jim&#39;s Original as well! It&#39;s so unique to eat a porkchop with the bone between two buns.,9,0,Dantee Arias

13,mYCXmqEdevo,"I&#39;ve lived in Chicago my whole life and agree with this. Tavern style pizza is the best. I&#39;ve had all of these foods except the cinnamon rolls, I will have to try those. I just had a bag of Garrets popcorn and couple of days ago. You forgot Polish Pierogies, Elis Cheesecake and Portillos. Gyros are also a Chicago staple.",6,0,Patricia Krakowiak

15,mYCXmqEdevo,"We definitely need a part 2. I try to tell folks. We indulge Deep Dish occasionally &amp; much prefer thin-crust Tavern style.<br> I&#39;m recommending Leon&#39;s B-BQ, Top Notch for burgers. Then slide over to Rainbow for ice cream. White Palace for Brunch.  Chinatown for Chinese &amp; Roeser&#39;s for baked goods.<br>Good stuff broüëçüèø",13,4,Gee Davia

34,mYCXmqEdevo,I&#39;m currently living in NYC and looking to transition to Chicago next year. Glad I found your channel! I dig it! ü§òüèæ,5,1,Soulafied
35,mYCXmqEdevo,"I tried a Chicago style hot dog on my first day in Chicago, and I knew right then that I would never leave.<br><br>Best way to eat Italian beef: order it wet with a side salad instead of fries. Eat it directly over the salad. Whatever falls or drips into the salad will make it taste better.<br><br>To anyone not from Chicago: he&#39;s right about the pizza. I only eat deep dish one to three times a year, mostly when entertaining people from out of town. I&#39;ve never heard of called tavern pizza, but that is what most of us eat most of the time. It generally has extra sauce, so the cheese slides right off, but you get extra tomato flavor that way, so it&#39;s worth it.",10,0,Paul T Sjordal
36,mYCXmqEdevo,"If you do a part two, you can&#39;t miss Ricobene&#39;s steak sandwich, Margie&#39;s Candies&#39; ice cream, or Calumet Fisheries&#39; smoked shrimp. . . and, as much as I like Lou&#39;s, it&#39;s a shame you didn&#39;t go to Pequod&#39;s.",5,0,Reuben Joseph Magbanua
37,mYCXmqEdevo,I have eaten at most of these places and I can tell you that Byron&#39;s Hot Dogs are a must! Whether before or after a Cubs game you must try one. Like he said in the video &quot;DO NOT&quot; order ketchup on your hot dog. Simply THE BEST!,0,0,ThreeG

39,mYCXmqEdevo,"Good selection of food items. Would add Maxwell Street Pork Chop sandwich to part 2. Make sure they include the serrano peppers.  Plus, add a BBQ dish. My favorite BBQ place is Leon&#39;s BBQ on Archer Ave. Thanks for pointing out the tavern style pizza is the standard. My father&#39;s favorite was the sausage pizza from Father and Son pizza. Cut up in squares. My favorite item from Harold&#39;s Chicken are the gizzards. They throw the hot sauce over the gizzards, fries and white bread that soaks it up.",0,0,Hector

I love deep dish (though prefer Giordano&#39;s); but square cut thin crust is what I try to tell folks is &quot;real&quot; Chicago style -- it doesn&#39;t help that I live in NY and everyone wants to reference John Stewart.

You won&#39;t regret it and save money over the cost of Wrigley Field concessions. Chicago Deep Dish is a tradition that you must uphold, there are several good establishments for this, including Lou Malnati&#39;s.

And in Chicago the saucier the better.<br>3) Atomic Cake - damn is it good; chocolate, strawberry, and banana sponges + filling<br>4) Breaded Steak sandwich - you think you want it with mozzarella, but you actually want it with marinara and peppers.<br>5) Gyros Plate - just heap together all of the gyros meat and pita you can find, on top of a bedrock of french fries barely contained in a cheap styrofoam package<br>6) Chili Cheese Polish - now yes these other food items are a bit embarrassing and I understand why only we will like them. But NOT the Maxwell Street Polish, the best hot dog in the world. The chili cheese polish is its slow, fat cousin.<br>7) Italian Beef + Sausage combo sandwich - thanks, I hate it.

Also too many pizza places to mention - and Chicagoans generally don&#39;t consider deep dish signature Chicago pizza.  It&#39;s great, but most people I know prefer thin crust.  For Mexican, just walk up and down Clark Street and sniff! You could also mention Cap&#39;n Nemos, some of the best subs anywhere.

Don&#39;t believe me dissect a piece next time you go to Giordano&#39;s and look closely at the amount of cheese your getting then the layer of dough over the top of the cheese and scrape away all that sauce that it&#39;s now drowning in and you&#39;ll see your not getting much of what your paying for, the amount of cheese you actually get is less then a normal thin crust at Phil&#39;s pizza off 89 and ridgeland in oaklawn. <br><br>If I splurge to get a deep dish or a stuffed pizza it better we&#39;ll be loaded with cheese cause what other reason would there be to order it. It&#39;s all about that cheese that can stretch for miles when you pick up a piping hot piece it&#39;s what makes it warm your heart and satisfy your soul. I just wish people would be blind and leave comments on their reviews to Giordano&#39;s and let them know ( where&#39;s the cheese ) ü§∑üèª untill then all I got is a distant memory of what a good pizza use to be üòû",0,0,Frank Frank

7379,oR1Sg83B3Os,"Argyle is just as old as South Chinatown, and their founders (Jimmy Wong and Ping Tom) knew each other and competed with each other.<br>When people were displaced from the Original Chinatown Downtown, both Wong and Tom sought different locations to relocate residents and businesses. Tom chose Little Italy, since it most of the Italian residents had relocated and integrated into other parts of the city and much of the land was for sale. Wong chose Uptown because of it&#39;s association with Night Life, and it was farther away from the crime-ridden South Side. This is when the Chinatown Wars took place, mostly non-violent, as extra-location businesses spots were bought up around Chicago (mostly restaurant, import and furniture spaces) as a way for each location to flex their influence. This ended in 1998. Argyle has been known as North Chinatown and Little Chinatown, but has also been known as Little Vietnam and Little Saigon. It wasn&#39;t called &quot;New Chinatown&quot; until recently, and only by outsiders (and it&#39;s considered a pejorative because it insults the historicity of the area).<br>Edit: Also, New Chinatown is the Official Name of the Norther Additions of Chinatown on Cermak, specially Chinatown Square Plaza.

9211,6RsE31BW6V4,Leave it to Chicago to screw up a simple cheesesteak. They chop up the meat way too fine. There are a lot of places in Philly that do that too‚Ä¶and they suck. No one wants to have meat fall out of the roll with every bite. Heating up the roll? Nah. I will say the amount of meat and cheese used was pretty generous. That‚Äôs a good thing. A number of places (including some of the famous ones) in Philly have gotten very skimpy with the beef. The roll on top with the flip is good technique. Didn‚Äôt cut all the way through the roll‚Ä¶more points scored. Some good and bad things. I‚Äôd be really disappointed with the chop of the meat though‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt need to be rebuilding the sandwich after I have a pile of meat on the paper halfway through. A rough chop is much better and gives it more of a steak texture instead of a ground beef sandwich.,1,0,shinner65

For just the building, 4 walls, a floor, and a roof is about $12,000,000, but that varies with local costs and how big of a Walmart they want. Land cost varies a LOT, but figure $4,000,000. Site improvements: pushing dirt around, paving the parking lot, sidewalks, driveways, power... $2,000,000. Equipment $4,000,000. All of these figures can vary a lot. All together it will be $22,000,000 plus stocking the store with goods.

10805,tDv_N-ZCPPc,"As a mostly conservative leaning person, I do think that Chicago officials should have worked out some kind of deal with Wal-Mart to keep them in Chicago.  One idea I had: they could have agreed to subsidize losses directly to Wal-Mart with cash, and in the meantime set up Chicago police substations at Wal-Mart manned by several cops (not just a couple on occasion), and have security guard ambassadors actively patrolling and with direct communications with the police officers who work out of the substations.  I am not familiar with the closed down locations (or the remaining ones) as far as how large they are, but oftentimes Wal-Marts are very large and have other shops in the lot.  Having a large, &#39;permanent&#39; police presence along with security guards could have made other retailers feel safe enough to set up stores as well.  If everything went well, Chicago would no longer need to subsidize Wal-Mart directly with cash, only with police and security &#39;ambassadors&#39;.  My guess is it will take millions of dollars annually to subsidize getting people to other shops, or directly bringing them food and whatnot, not to mention the city getting sales tax to help offset costs of security.  Also, the officials could have patted themselves on their collective backs in press conferences praising how they &#39;saved&#39; residents&#39; buying choices rather than having a press conference making empty threats of boycotts.",0,0,culcune

The income levels aren&#39;t here to support them. Now only a county over, there is a town that is growing like mad because it established itself as a retirement community with wealthy northern folks many years ago who invested in that area and built golf courses and horse stables. Home values there are three to four times that of my county. They have all the big box stores, all the fancy grocery stores. Heck they even have a couple that you can drink wine and eat fine meals in while you grocery shop. You walk into one of these stores and they are playing classical music for God&#39;s sake. Heck I went to one once up there and they had a women paying the Celo and one playing the violin! In the store! Now if they tried that in my town, their instruments would be stolen the minute that they went to the bathroom. The one thing that you don&#39;t see up there in the adjacent town is waste on the streets, cluttered stores, unfriendly help, people riding through the parking lot booming offensive music.

I said exactly given the chance anyone would move their family out a bad area. It has nothing to do with racism. So it‚Äôs racists if whites move in and it‚Äôs racist if they move out. White people racists regardless what they do. When my family immigrated to the US in the 80‚Äôs we rented a 2 bed room 1 floor house for 8 people.

11509,FYKyVXS5DDw,I used to travel for work to Chicago a couple times a month and developed a taste for deep dish pizza.  I used to bring pies home with me when I drove there in an ice chest.  Now I make a Chicago style deep dish pizza at home about once a month.  I used a 22 inch cast iron skillet for my pan and coat it butter and evoo than dust it with finely grated parmigiana cheese and stretch my dough out on the counter and transfer it into my preferred pan like a pie crust. As for how I top my pie just like what you saw on this video. As for the sauce I make my own from canned whole tomatoes and add some herbs and spices but my secret step is I drain the liquid from the cans of tomatoes and boil it down slowly until it‚Äôs basically a sauce and then add that back to whole tomatoes that I have chopped up but not cooked. Lastly because I like onions and artichokes I place sliced ones on top of the sauce along with a dusting of the undisputed king of cheeses and a drizzle of evoo,91,9,gullreefclub

I&#39;m a simple guy, choosing just the Classic Cheese/Sausage Pan with the Butter Crust.  You really only need one meat on a pie like this as it covers the entire surface.  Every part of this pizza is an ingredient, including the crust.  It does so much more than simply hold up the toppings, it is it&#39;s own taste treat rich in buttery, gooey goodness, especially when the juice from the tomatoes works it&#39;s magic in the butter.  It&#39;s just so delicious!

Your really brought out the best of what Chicago is or was.",7,1,James Buckley
14148,xlAo5Qk_HBg,I almost didn&#39;t watch this because I didn&#39;t think Chicago wine would be interesting.   I was wrong and it ended up being my favorite episode so far.  Working as a sommelier at Gibsons (or any restaurant) is extremely difficult and you explained in detail what they go through each night.  I waited tables and couldn&#39;t take the stress.   Kelly Palmer made it look easy and she seems like a really cool person. Thank you for such a fun show!,2,1,Mark Medley

As a tribute to the place you feel like home it was beautifully made and felt quite authentic with some great people in it.<br>Top notch quality on video editing, very good taste on image and scenery selection, the empathy and free flow of speech that makes us feel like we&#39;re there in a group of friends. And the right amount of technical jargon, just enough to be informative without becoming boring. Always down to earth, never pedantic nor fake complexity. A job well done. Although the Nerd Lab felt a bit too all over the place.<br>But I do prefer episodes on the actual wines, wineries and wine regions/countries.<br>As for wine price range, what could be considered an urban myth in the US is actual reality in other countries.",3,6,Monsal Varga

My one counter to that would be the great high end food market type stores like Corti Brothers in Sacramento, Central Market in Texas, Wegmans in New York, and others. They have a wine staff and really carry whole departments of wine and its all pretty carefully chosen. These types of stores are not that common -especially in some areas, though. So your advice is totally valid.",1,1,Shawn Hampton

14173,xlAo5Qk_HBg,"great video all around! thanks for taking the time to make it.<br><br><br>i would say take a little caution with the wine buying tips here:<br>you should definitely pay attention to labels. they tell you a ton about the wine, from ABV to PDO/DOCG etc status, grape varietal and % used. if the wine is sourced from a large region (california vs single estate napa)<br>do not ignore bottle descriptors, even he says as much after telling you to ignore them, it will give you insight into the wine making methods and the characteristics of the wine. OF course they are made to sell wine, but to the people that would enjoy wine made in that style. If the descriptors are just to sell wine then they would say &quot;taste like the most amazing thing you have ever drank and will also make you wealthy (possibly)&quot;<br>$15-30 sweet spot is an urban myth. If you limit yourself to this realm you will never try a world class wine. A langhe Nebbiolo is nothing like a Barolo. Langhe nebs are often the younger/lower elevation/inferior fruit that does not make the cut or is not grown in the legal area for barolo. IT does not see as much maturation or oak use as well as vinification methods. If you want a Barolo and someone sells you a Langhe Nebbiolo instead, you will be an unhappy person that saved a little money.<br><br>he says get specific right after  telling you not to buy a barolo but to buy a langhe neb, the much larger general region encompassing barolo.&#39;<br><br>8. abv, that is on the label which step 3 tells you to ignore.<br><br>well intentioned but my best advice is when you are shopping for wine, spend within your budget, ask for help from employees (often they are well trained and can help you find a bottle ideally suited), buy something you like and are familiar with and buy something new. Read the labels, buy the better wines if you want to try them.<br><br>Sure there are value wines out there and if you are budget minded then spend less and look for comparable regions with value, but if you are interested in trying wines....these buying tips are going to keep you from trying/tasting some of the best wines in the world.",4,3,Joseph ryan
14174,xlAo5Qk_HBg,"Mega Purple/Purple 8000 is just juice concentrate from rubired fruit, and it - along with other concentrates - was used even in higher-end wines during NorCal&#39;s &quot;green year&quot; (2011).

14778,8b1cFKXKpM0,"Hello my friend. I feel comfortable and funny when you have a new content. You always introduce about special and delicious food of different countries around the world. So wonderful. I like food. I think food is not just eating energy. It&#39;s an experience. And good food is the foundation of genuine happiness. Besides, there is nothing more romantic than delicious food. I also love street food. Maybe the confluence of people, smells and tastes that you are privy to merely by eating on the street is very special. And it is not something that can be replicated indoors. If food is a lens through which to see the world, a seat at one of those tiny tables offers the best view. Also, food is for eating and good food is to be enjoyed. I think food is actually, very beautiful in itself. You help me know and understand about receipt for food, manufacturing process, material and ingredient of the food at the places that you experience.  Bread and banana. It is so yummy. I like and want to taste it if i have a chance. Thank you for sharing. Stay health and safe. See you around.",19,2,Th·ªßy D∆∞∆°ng vlog
