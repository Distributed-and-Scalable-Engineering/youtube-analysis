0,dNU1lJiDaSY,I studied at the Academy of Health Sciences at Fort Sam Houston in 1988 and 1994 and in both occasions I immensely enjoyed my stay at San Antonio. I fervently wish I could go back to Texas and explore the amazing  places I haven&#39;t seen. Love from the Philippines.,34,1,Maritoni Hernandez
1,dNU1lJiDaSY,"So much was left off this list.  I am a native Texan and am still discovering wonderful, unique gems in my state.  I currently live in Rockport which is on the Texas coast in the Coastal Bend area (think Corpus Christi).  This place has so much history and many festivals which make it an amazing place to be. Another unique tour to do in Texas is a tour of the Painted Churches.  These are unique pieces of Texas history and are located in or near communities that are worth a visit.  The last thing I will mention is the Kolache Tour of Texas which is an homage to our Czech heritage.  It is worth digging beyond the usual places always mentioned in videos of Texas.",31,3,ecneb

397,bdKHTIHEaQ0,"Let me help out here, as I‚Äôm a native Texan. You can visit Corpus Christi, Mustang Island, and Port Aransas in one day if so inclined. The description was pretty off directionally, but no worries, it‚Äôs a little confusing since that entire area is considered Padre Island (not to be confused with South Padre Island also know as SPI, and to make it a little more confusing, the main road that turns into Park 22 is named South Padre Island Rd. <br>So here‚Äôs the best part, if you go to Corpus Christ , from now on CC, you can either stay on Park 22 and visit White Cap beach, you will see signs that say beach access road followed by a number, if driving south you will turn left and in about 1/2 a mile you‚Äôre on the beach. This one is pretty lively, lots of waves, and a strong breeze to help keep you cooled off. Now our favorite place to visit is on 361, turning left at Park 22 onto 361 will give you access to The Gulf Of Mexico on your right, and Laguna Madre (great for fishing) on your left, you will see lots of places to park to access either body of water. You will also drive past Mustang Island National Park, it‚Äôs between Port Aransas and CC, not south of CC as the speaker mentioned. It is so natural and beautiful, very serene and peaceful. If you continue east on 361 and enter the first Beach Access road you see, you can drive along the beach and park anywhere you desire, which is awesome if you have children, elderly, or disabled people with you, no hiking thru hot and soft sand, just park and start having fun. You can even drive all the way to Port Aransas (our favorite destination for food!) the only difference is vehicles must be parked in designated areas, and there‚Äôs a short walk thru that soft sand to the waters edge. It‚Äôs important to stop at any convenience store, and buy an annual pass, around $12 for the year, and get this, you can camp out on the beach if you want! <br><br>I see a lot of people feel the same as I do, not mentioning Dallas or Fort Wirth is INSANE. The Fort Worth Stockyard are so historic, and a couple of times a day they drive the long horns thru by real cowboys, also, Ft.Worth and Dallas both have beautiful Zoo‚Äôs. I‚Äôm smh wondering how a tourist trap in Waco made the cut, and DFW did not, Magnolia is like going to Garden Ridge or some other budget retailer for home decor, except a coffee mug with Magnolia stamped on it is $24 dollars! üòÆthere‚Äôs not much to see, and the lines to the bakery are usually about an hour long, to by a cupcake, or cookie, and do not waste your money at the Dr. Pepper museum, you WILL be disappointed. It‚Äôs 10 minutes before boredom kicks in, and when we went they didn‚Äôt even offer samples, no little free souvenirs, a sad excuse to us. Just still a little salty about it. Now, there are some tours along the Brazos river that runs past Baylors football stadium, THAT was great, if I can find the info on the tour I will come back and add it here. <br>Sa Antonio can be a nice weekend trip, but remember The Alamo  is just a building, and the river walk is nice, but it doesn‚Äôt go all the way around, you get on, ride to the end, then walk back. There are some great restaurants, this is more of a good date night, due to some of the restaurants, kids will be bored quickly. <br>Oh, one more thing, so you don‚Äôt get looked at like your crazy, it H-you-ston not Whoston",2,0,Valerie F

Because of all the recent immigration from other states (especially California(I always welcome them back because many people left Texas during the Great Depression and went to cali)), big city&#39;s have a different feel from small towns.  So do not be afraid to get off the interstate, there are a couple places to be wary of (like Comanche), but most will warn you before going there.

UNT Is famous for music and Psychology. Small town school systems are great for kids out here because they have more opportunity. Some schools even have elementary straight through highschool, keeping to a comfortable sort of homeliness to what is usually a scary change for young children.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget that like everywhere else, culture is still diverse. We get people from all over America, people from all over Mexico, and people from Japan to China to Germany. This is a big reason why the state isn&#39;t considered too southern in comparison to it&#39;s neighbors and has such a unique feeling when you move through different towns and backroads.<br><br>Don&#39;t be stupid. You can get shot out here and for what you might think is relatively normal elsewhere, if it&#39;s illegal here, don&#39;t underestimate it. Texas is notorious for feeling lax, then taking law breakers and figuratively bashing their skulls in. If it&#39;s a law here, it&#39;s usually serious.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget that there are dangerous parts to the state. Major cities like HOUSTON and Dallas and Fort Worth are rampant with it. People steal, people fight, people kill. Open carry has a decent reason to exist here honestly, but sadly. Luckily, the gang cultures and rap and racial situations aren&#39;t really as bad as it might seem. As long as you make a real effort to be polite, even the most intimidating people are friendly, and racism and, more specifically, stereotypes don&#39;t hold anyone back long as it isn&#39;t paid any heed or practiced.

851,OyzlwL4wNRs,"Hmm tips from a Texan in Texas.  Here‚Äôs a few.<br>1. Good pair of walking shoes are a must, you will walk a lot. Square toed boots are popular here due to comfort ( once broken in that is, they can be rough while new) and durability. Leather boots are popular since they can help insulate your feet from the very hot tarmac or packed earth. what heat you‚Äôll feel from wearing them is often less than the residual heat you‚Äôll get from sun baked earth.<br>IMPORTANT if you do get square toed boots, wear taller socks or even knee socks until you get used to wearing them, otherwise you‚Äôll get very interesting blisters and scars on your calves. Those take a while to heal.<br><br>2. layer your clothing and wear cotton or linen. parts of Texas are arid to semi arid (West, central and south especially)  which means they are hot and/ or humid depending on the time of year. contrary to most places conventional wisdom ( and part of the cowboy stereotype) jeans in the summer are actually a good thing, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see natives wearing cotton or linen button down shirts and undershirts with jeans. The cotton and linen fabric help hold onto sweat in a way that will usually keep you cooled. IMPORTANT socks are pivotal to your daily comfort if your outside here, keep em clean and they will keep you cool . Worn or dirty socks and clothing will make you heat up faster as they don‚Äôt retain  sweat as well or at all. Also exposed skin is skin that can be turned into chicharron if your not careful. If you don‚Äôt want to layer up, keep shade on you with a wide brimmed hat or a Paracel, sunblock only goes so far.<br><br>3.WATER WATER WATER. Always have a source of water on you or near you at all times if your out and about. For most of Texas history water was a valuable resource on par with salt or gold in some areas due to climate and scarcity. Heat exhaustion is no joke and sun stroke can and will kill you, always stay topped up. IMPORTANT DO NOT CAMEL WATER drinking large amounts of water in a single shot can cause some problems with heat related illnesses, even the very early stages, it‚Äôs better to have a slow and steady intake of water as you go about your business and have fun. Otherwise you stand a pretty good chance of passing out if your not lucky.( it also helps you win drinking games as well, the water, not the passing out)<br><br>4. Take frequent breaks in the spring and summer months as heat affects everybody differently and often times, very quickly. That tiredness your feeling may be dehydration or early stages of sunstroke known as heat exhaustion ( which is sometimes referred to being sun drunk or sun punched due to the fact some people  become notably less lucid as their brain literally is cooked by the sun). Natives may give you some friendly ribbing about being unused to the weather , but this is something most of us are taught from a very young age to be conscience of and have actively built a higher tolerance to to be comfortable and functional here. There is no shame in not being able to one shot a hiking trail in 120 degree (49 degrees Celsius) heat. Don‚Äôt let your pride kill you or get your brain literally cooked in the sun. You can and will lose iq and other mental faculty due to sunstroke and heat related illnesses.<br><br>5. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you see someone carrying guns or knives in public, you are perfectly safe... probably . While cities have noticeably fewer visible carriers, many Texans carry knives on their belts or in their pockets due to simply convenience and utility in their day to day lives. If your from part of the world where these things are uncommon or illegal (London, Japan, etc.) it can be a bit of a very uncomfortable culture shock. Texans hold gun safety and personal responsibility as very important things regardless of the individuals politics ( usually) so don‚Äôt expect them to be discharged or utilized without good reason. IMPORTANT DO NOT ASK TO SEE SOMEONES CARRY PEICE OR FIRE ARM AS IT IS USUALLY CONSIDERED RUDE OR PRIVATE INFORMATION, IF THEY WANTED YOU TO SEE IT, THEY‚ÄôD‚ÄôVE SHOWN IT TO YOU OR INQUIRED IF YOU WANTED TO SEE IT OR HANDLE IT. The same rules roughly apply to firearms kept in house or on private property. <br>IMPORTANT If you haven‚Äôt had firearm safety well and truly beaten ( literally)  into your head to the point of habit, it‚Äôs better to usually not handle firearms unless it‚Äôs a life or death emergency as a visitor.<br><br>6. Be an assertive driver, while not as aggressive as los Angeline drivers, Texas drivers can be very... bullheaded. Be firm but fair with offensive driving techniques and you usually won‚Äôt have too many problems on the road. NOTE Most Texans speed on the highways and if the high speeds make you uncomfortable, don‚Äôt forget that there are many Farm to Market roads (ie signs which say things like F.M 3009) which acted  as highways before they where implemented federally. While these roads may be slower, they are often times the more direct and scenic routes in your intra-city traveling, leading you to more small towns and interesting sights which may only be seen seasonally with sufficient planning. IMPORTANT if you are going to be traveling between cities I would suggest driving a mid sized SUV, as much of the country traffic consists of light duty and 3/4 tonne trucks just for safety reasons. The gas mileage isn‚Äôt worth your safety to be Frank if you where to get into an accident.<br><br>7. Don‚Äôt be afraid to smile and wave! Americans love tourists and travelers in general, and Texas is no exception. Aside being aware of a handful of particular social cues found really inside all of the United States,  don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions or talk/ ask the locals for help as many Americans will go out of their way if they can to get you to where you want to go.<br><br>8. Don‚Äôt buy stuff you can‚Äôt take back with you.  Seriously.<br>ESPECIALLY if you are a foreigner, do not attempt to purchase a firearm, as that will usually never end well. ( Either you get a stern talking to or somehow illegally acquire one, both are bad for different-reasons and can have long term consequences that are not immediately apparent.). Side note, some snakeskin stuff is verboten in some countries. While it‚Äôs kosher here since some snakes are considered pests, that may not be the case everywhere. <br>IMPORTANT in some places you will find some, uh, interesting  and questionable liquors and spirits. Texas is known for its beer and whiskey, but if someone offers you snake whiskey or some snake or scorpion themed beverage, don‚Äôt take it, as there is a chance that venom is present in the drink. While the venoms in the drinks are technically edible, it will act as a potent hallucinogenic, and if you have ulcers, could kill you as if you had been bitten by whatever had produced the venom.<br><br>9. Well beaten paths are trodden for a reason. If you are out hiking try not to forage your own unique trails if it can be avoided, much of Texas has fairly rough terrain with flora and fauna that reflect that. <br>Much of central and south Texas is composed of limestone, so there are cave entrances that may lead to an aquifer, sheer drop, or cave system, and will usually surprise you by looking like a diminutive crack in the ground, until you step on it reveal it‚Äôs true nature. While this in quite rare, is a possibility. Highly venomous spiders , insects, and snakes are an everyday picture in much of Texas and many  cute critters spread some nasty diseases. Avoid eating any wild agave you might find as there are common varieties that can be toxic. <br>Mind your step because cactus spines (which can and will go through hiking boots) are the best kind of whoopsi you‚Äôll get if you misplace your feet!<br><br>10. This ain‚Äôt there and there ain‚Äôt here. Texans are generally friendly and gregarious if given the choice, and will usually find joy in cultural differences among travelers. But Texans are prideful and may not back down if they think they are intentionally being insulated or threatened. Many places have different rules on etiquette but as a rule of thumb, if you get into a heated argument with a Texan, physical contact of any sort will likely escalate the issue instead making it worse, as it is considered a declaration of dominance or superiority.Things like hiding your hands  or eyes ( hands in pockets or jacket and sunglasses) won‚Äôt help in that kind of scenario either. Best thing you can due is turn their attention away from you and let them cool off for a bit and get back to whatever they where doing. Remember, firm but fair is respect. Don‚Äôt let yourself get steamrolled, but dont try to steamroll anyone else and you‚Äôll have a good time.",81,10,zachp97

Also, it is very annoying when people complain about the weather, we expect you to have done your research before going anywhere. Some of us are really blunt too, so don&#39;t be surprised if someone is overly honest towards you or a companion. And if you don&#39;t know Spanish, you may want to have someone familiar with the area along for the ride. Don&#39;t avoid places that speak a lot of Spanish, you can probably ask a local or something for assistance. Also, we Texans are proud of our state, so don&#39;t go saying that we&#39;re shit, you&#39;ll probably get punched in the face. Oh, and buy some Texas Merchandise, it is literally everywhere. Texas pans, shirts, pots, signs, guns, stuffed animals, etc. Speaking of animals, try not to run over the armadillos, or any other animal, because it isn&#39;t an uncommon sight to see one on the side of the road, or attempting to cross it, especially on those roads in the middle of nowhere. And yes, you may need entertainment for the drive, so stopping in the towns on the way to your destination is great. It takes 4-5 hours to get to San Antonio from Dallas, and 7-8 to get to San Juan from Dallas. I have close family in each of those cities that I visit every month, so those were the first examples that came to mind. Now, I haven&#39;t been everywhere, but I suggest going around Austin if you don&#39;t intend on stopping there(I usually don&#39;t) because if you don&#39;t go around, you will get stuck in traffic. It may seem like a detour, but a bit of extra mileage isn&#39;t going to kill you when compared to Austin Traffic. I also recommend that you avoid it completely during rush hour. This goes for other major cities too, like San Antonio, Houston and Dallas, but they aren&#39;t nearly as bad, they really only come close when Rush Hour hits. Trust me, I&#39;ve lived in both Dallas and San Antonio. Now, that was your minor lesson on Texas, buy the Lone Star State Merch and have a nice life! Oh, and if it isn&#39;t too much of a burden, please visit South Padre Island, summer time is the best time and it usually isn&#39;t extremely crowded, but you will get to see and maybe even meet new people.",24,3,VioHRD

It takes us 8 hours to get from our campground to the north side near Arkansas or to the Texas/Louisiana border.<br>2) The people down here are very friendly and welcoming. They are extremely polite and every phrase is literally ended with Sir or Ma&#39;am. They are not all rich and appreciate that you are here and spend your money in the area. They live on that income during the summer months when we have gone back home.<br>3) The food is fantastic. As said in the video, the Tex-Mex is mouth watering, as is the beef. You will get REAL Mexican food down here so don&#39;t be surprised if your nachos do not look like the ones you order back home. They will also make you never want to order any Mexican food once you get back home as it will taste like &#39;crap&#39;. <br>4) Yes, it does snow in the winter even way down south where we vacation. Dec. 8th, 2018 we got hit with some of the white stuff, although it was only a slight dusting.

Another is to stay out of trouble, don‚Äôt touch anybody or make threats, you never know who‚Äôs carrying a gun, and a verbal threat of harm is taken as seriously as actually doing it. Manners y‚Äôall! Another good tip, is to stay off the highways if you aren‚Äôt okay with heavy traffic, especially around Houston and Austin.

Your wide eyed enthusiasm and razor-sharp intellect also reinforced a feeling in me that I need to get out there and see more of this land I&#39;ve lived in all my life, share it with my dog, and try to remember that regardless of all the divisions and hostilities that exist between us as Americans, we&#39;re all just people floating on this rock for a brief moment in time.

Felt super exotic to me, just as you describe your first days in the United States. <br><br>I loved so much about Poland. The people were so friendly, warm and generous. They thought me exotic because they heard about America but had never met an American ‚Äì most of them. People invited me into their homes and their lives. Behaved as if I were the king of England. Wanted to discuss politics and know everything possible about the U.S. <br><br>I loved the food. Pirogi, kapitka, bigos. Oh, how I loved bigos. In those days there were still milk bars. They were amazing. Sadly, within a few years they were all but gone, replaced by KFCs and Burger Kings. I‚Äôll never understand why Poland was so eager to embrace the worst of American culture. <br><br>My first trip to Krakow was a kind of heaven. In those days, the buildings were still decrepit and they had stuff like toilet paper (brown and rough like sand paper) in the shop windows. The people hadn‚Äôt yet wrapped their minds around basic capitalistic concepts, which led to a lot of interesting economic choices. But it was all so real and so beautiful and so charming. I liked Krakow way better then than, later on, after it had all been fixed up and the shops filled with tourist goods. <br><br>I met many wonderful people who became good friends. I also met a woman. We fell in love, dated long distance and eventually married. We were young and still had much to learn. We had love to burn but burn it we did. Eventually she left me but she was brilliant. In Poland, she was on a track to be someone important. She gave up that track to move to the U.S. but she began again, graduated college with a 4.0 GPA, attended medical school and is not just a cardiologist today but the head of a cardiology department. More impressive than that, the nurses adore her. For me, that‚Äôs the greatest honor a physician could have ‚Äì to be loved by those who are in the trenches caring for people day and night. <br><br>I met so many other folks whom I‚Äôll never forget. People so kind, so generous, so full of idealism. I remember one family, poor as church mice but their home (with ten children) was overflowing with love. <br><br>My grandmother came from a small town in Poland. She told me all these stories from her childhood. That‚Äôs what motivated my odyssey. To see those places. That‚Äôs the same town where I met my ex-wife. <br><br>I don‚Äôt mean to imply that Polish society is perfect or ideal. There were many problems, just like anywhere else. What one loves is more about the person making the evaluation than the place itself. So I guess, in speaking about Poland, I‚Äôm speaking about myself.

2069,vGPwDxQzUeY,"Oh wow you went through my city in this video! Along route 66 Amarillo Texas. That&#39;s where the drive in store was Toot N&#39; Totum. You were amazed by the drive through feature, but the interesting part you didn&#39;t know is when the store was first opened way back in the 1950&#39;s customers would pull up to the store and honk and they would come out and serve you. If you needed gas or a drink or what ever they would fill up your car or bring you what you ordered similar to how they do the drive through. That is where the name Toot N&#39; Totum came from. You Toot your horn and they came out. Also I think the girl was confused when you ordered your water because there are so many different brands and kinds of still water they sell. But she was most likely used to customers ordering what brand of water. So when you asked if they had sparkling water or still water I guarantee she was confused inside her head and didn&#39;t fully understand what you were asking. They have both sparkling water and still. They have Spring Water like the bottle of Ozarka (Texas Brand) you got then they have Distilled Water, Smart Water, Alkaline Water, Electrolyte Water, and Reverse Osmosis Water and Sparkling Waters. Then you have different brands of each. Usually they just expect you to know exactly what you want. That&#39;s really the purpose of the drive through is a shortcut to quickly order everything you know you want or need. If you are a regular customer and know everything they have there. That&#39;s why there is no menu or anything. If you want to shop around you just go in like a normal store.

I lived in an RV park, and the people there are really kind. The owner of the park made sure that I was comfortable in my new environment, and my neighbors really looked after me. I came to the US with absolutely zero driving experience. But when I learned to drive, in three months&#39; time I started my first road trip to Nebraska. That&#39;s when I truly realized how massive Texas (and the US) is!  The people are so amazing. There is one thing that is hard not to notice - every stranger that I met is friendly, always ready to offer help whenever I needed one and kind especially in rural towns. <br><br>I have to say, my road trips in the US offered kind of a profound spiritual experience. I come from a country where a great number of the population claim being religious. But I have never experienced in my life having random strangers invite me to a moment of silence while they pray over me as I go along my journey.

The most modern thing you showed us was the Walmart, and we‚Äôve had those in the states for well over 45 years!  I suppose all of that old iconic stuff you showed us (Rte. 66, RV parks, drive through pharmacy pickup windows, etc.) provide that ‚Äúother worldly experience‚Äù to someone whose never seen it before.  I am from a big city in Texas, Dallas, fully modern, skyscrapers, enormous international airport, 3 lane intermediate roads everywhere, tree-lined streets and multiple parks and residential housing and apartments everywhere.  Commuter rail lines into various key points in the city and venues.  Yes, Texas is HUGE, and has so much diversity of landscape, desert, rolling prairie, mountains, lakes, piney forests.  So many East and West-Coast USA citizens used to abhor the Mid-States of the US, but now, they are moving in droves to here, to take advantage of the lower housing prices, lower taxes, lower food prices, and generally friendly attitudes.  However, they are selling their previous domicile at a higher price and moving here to make a profit - THIS is driving our housing market prices higher, partly because the demand is so high, and partly because home and land developers know they have the excess funds and are raising the prices for homes and apartments.  Texas was one of the best-kept secrets for cost of living, until a few years ago - so it‚Äôs getting more expensive, Californians and New Yorkers - their prices following them as they migrate.<br>Well, Eva, thanks for showing us your joy, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy the lonely spaces as well as the big modern cities.

Trucks that are lifted ridiculous heights off the ground are toys.  You see that more in the cities.  I&#39;ve heard it called a feed sack test or a hay bale test, but if the bed of the truck to too high to load (feed sacks or a square bale), then it&#39;s a toy.  Thanks for taking the back roads, some awesome views.  West Texas and the pan handle are an acquired taste for most.

It was ice cream and I had a bottle of Coke with me so I poured it in and had myself a float.

CO has a ton of micro breweries, though I‚Äôm not a beer fan. Also, college sports or HS sports are huge here, not just the major leagues.<br>If you can, you should check out the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone (if it‚Äôs open), the sand dunes either in CO or Utah, the Redwood forest, or wherever your heart pulls you. <br>Drive safe out there, know your own limits, and have a plan of action for the unplanned.

Since long haul trucking is very common here there are lot of rest-stops and places that can tow/repair a vehicle, lots of places that are open 24/7, especially hotels off major highways. The most dangerous part of traveling are the roads, but in a 4x4 like this you&#39;re MORE than fine.

We have the top cancer center in the world along with one the best burn centers, and children‚Äôs hospital. Houston is home to the best heart specialists in the world.

I live in the Mid-Cities area, which is a group of small cities between Dallas and Fort Worth. I&#39;m not far from DFW Airport and can fly pretty much anywhere in the world if I need a change of scenery. One thing I would like to make people aware of is that Texas has higher than average Property Taxes and Sales Tax.

I&#39;ve been away for over 20 years, with my career taking me to other places, but I am always happy to have grown up as a Texan.   I&#39;m bias against modern change (for the worse) ... I think living in Texas was better in the 70s and and 80s than it is today with traffic and overgrown areas, and yes.. the (mostly) California migration mucking it up.   As long as it can do it&#39;s hipster hippy demographic while maintaining plenty of conservative underlying values among those tie died spirits, and it doesn&#39;t go all-out, full Leftist mentally deranged as California&#39;s cities have done, then I think Texas as a whole will be wonderful place to live for very long time to come. That would make me happy to see it held to it&#39;s original character -- anything less would be a failure in my mind.   Much like I wish the country as a whole would hold to it&#39;s original values  -- with it&#39;s more conservative roots being what did more to build it up as the great nation over the years -- but then threat of change is a much bigger topic.",0,0,Dirk S

The state is pretty boring as a whole too, just vast amounts of empty land, or cities that seem like they&#39;re trying to use up as much land as possible with strip malls and restaurant chains just because they can, resulting in needing cars to get anywhere because everything is so spread out. Literally the only way to get anywhere is by car, because public transportation sucks and the weather is usually too hot to walk in. The nature is really beautiful, except for the beaches. Seriously, what&#39;s the big deal about Galveston? It&#39;s honestly a cool town but the beach, the main attraction, is disgusting. Still, there are good parts of Texas, like the job opportunities. Lots of great restaurants. But don&#39;t get me started on the suburbs- jesus christ when I die and go to hell I won&#39;t be surprised to see that hell is just the suburbs in Texas.

4430,GFvQN5FJvU0,"Just to correct some of the factual inaccuracies: Texas never won its independence, and it was nowhere near the size the video shows.

I‚Äôve been to the hat store in Paris where their embassy used to be.   Secondly , grab a map and a history book.  Texas used to protrude further north but was not nearly as wide as it is even today, much less the map the video pops up.   <br><br>Texas is full of good people, great countryside, and terrible politicians who have had their hand in printing this fictional status of their own sovereignty for so long that many people believe that nonsense.

4633,TMr7Ty064mM,"As Wolter said, DFW is big. It&#39;s actually HUGE. East side of Dallas to West side of Ft Worth can easily be a two hour drive. We&#39;re talking an urban area about the size of Rhode Island here. Also, to sum up the difference between Dallas and Ft Worth, Dallas has long been focused on business, banking and mercantile whereas Ft Worth has long been livestock and agriculture. Dallas will be a bit more upbeat and cosmopolitan while Ft Worth will be a bit more laid back and country feel. Not everything will be this way but you&#39;ll see this more in the tourist areas and such like Dallas&#39; art and science museums as opposed to Cowboy museum, rodeo and Stockyard attractions of Ft Worth. Both of these cities, as you said are connected by Arlington and host of other little towns and cities that all run together and sometimes make you guess where you are. There&#39;s not always a rural gap between cities and DFW is pretty much one huge urban/suburban Metroplex. Oh, and don&#39;t forget Denton either! Great Vlog, Walter, keep up the good work!",138,16,Mike Weston
4634,TMr7Ty064mM,"As a Texas native and long time resident of Grand Prairie I&#39;m here to tell you July/August isn&#39;t summer, summer is May/June. Sometimes summer is April but July/August is a new season other states don&#39;t have called Melt. This has been a public service announcement",15,1,Ej Edwards
4635,TMr7Ty064mM,"My rule of thumb for finding great hole in the wall/gas station eats is to look for a parking lot which is overflowing with building contractors trucks at breakfast or lunch time.  Your plumbers, landscapers, roofers, etc. are typically locals who dine out every workday and who know where to find the best cheap, good, and fast food.",126,5,HgMan 3
4636,TMr7Ty064mM,There is public transportation between Fort Worth and Dallas. It&#39;s the Trinty Railway Express. It is a scenic train ride that takes about 45 minutes. It costs around $10.,23,1,Brian B
4637,TMr7Ty064mM,"DO NOT underestimate the weather here, especially in the winter! It&#39;s not a joke to say it can be 70F with tornadoes one day, 90F 2 days later, and snow/ice 2 days after that.

As others have mentioned, Ft Worth&#39;s art museums certainly rival Dallas&#39; (though the DMA is more comprehensive) and are pretty much the main thing I trek over there for.<br>The Dallas Zoo has gotten a lot better in recent years, though I&#39;ve also heard the FW Zoo has added some improvements.<br>In terms of nightlife, go to Deep Ellum or Lower Greenville, and do not limit yourself to Tex-Mex and BBQ. Also, the Texas Theatre is a great historic movie theatre in Oak Cliff that is the sight of Lee Harvey Oswald&#39;s arrest.  <br>If you are more of a hippy than a sports fan, trek up to Denton if you want to see what Austin used to be like.<br>And if you are a sports fan, don&#39;t forget that the home of the Mavs and the Stars is conveniently located near downtown and accessible by public transit.",3,0,Robert Dullnig

4643,TMr7Ty064mM,"To touch on the transportation between Dallas and Ft. Worth, you can take the TRE between the two cities. If you want great food  in Ft. Worth, try going to the West End. Ft. Worth is more than just the Stockyards.",94,7,Mary Eckert
4644,TMr7Ty064mM,"I know a lot of people have already said it, but I might as well too. The train system in DFW works pretty owell around here, I&#39;ve used it tons of times. The DART trains go just about everywhere around Dallas, and out into the suburbs, the TRE goes from Dallas to Fort Worth and back, and the A-Train goes from the DART station in Carrollton (just north of Dalas,) up to Denton, where I live. Also, if you like live music, come to Denton, we have so much of it.",3,0,Ethan Ligon
4645,TMr7Ty064mM,"I‚Äôm from Dallas, but I can hardly believe that you mentioned the Dallas Museum of Art and the Perot Museum, but failed to mention the  Fort Worth Kimbell, Fort Worth Amon Carter, or the Fort Worth Modern museum, etc.  These are the museums by which all Texas (-much to the chagrin of Houston, not just DFW) museums must be compared, both in collections and in architecture. They were all designed by Pritzker prize winning architects, as were many of the buildings the Dallas Arts District, the largest contiguous arts district in the country. Regarding transportation, despite all the advances touted by the previous posts, if you are a tourist, there may be some areas where you can conveniently hop onto and off of public transportation, but there are many more gaping holes in the transportation options. Renting a car is typically easier, though as was mentioned, many of the drivers here in Dallas are recently transplanted from California, New York, Florida, and all points on the globe, so expect just as many driving styles.",6,1,David Dodds
4646,TMr7Ty064mM,Thanks for the video.  First time to watch and as have been in DFW for +15 years I think you hit the high notes.

4650,TMr7Ty064mM,"We are in rural TX west of the metro.  I loved this so much, leave it to y&#39;all to inspire locals (as well as everybody else) to get excited about what we have near to us.   One bit of advice I have is this:  If you get a rental car at the airport, PAY SUPER-CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SIGNS when you go to return it.  For some reason, it trips up a lot of people (way more than other airports, seriously)  if they&#39;re distracted one iota and they miss the turns, end up having to go way out and turn around.

4655,TMr7Ty064mM,"Fort Worthian here, with a correction/elaboration.<br><br>Just for the record, the public transportation point (saw that one coming from a country mile away) is a big misconception: North Central Texas public transit, while it used to be almost abysmal, has advanced basically <b>light-years</b> and become quite alright, especially in the past ten years. Tourists, public transit might do ya just fine, depending:<br><br>* Arlington, for anyone who doesn&#39;t care about lining Jerry Jones&#39; pocket or insanely overly-expensive amusement parks, is not a necessary visit. Plus, they actually do have pseudo-transit now in the form of &quot;Via&quot; rideshare (think a cross between a bus and Uber/Lyft that uses vans) that links to CentrePort Station on the TRE. No idea what&#39;s with their seeming allergy to just having buses. Must be something in the water. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you want Arlington, though - yeah, best to drive.<br>* Speaking of the TRE, the downtowns of the &quot;D&quot; &amp; the &quot;FW&quot; are linked by it - it&#39;s a train, and the acronym stands for Trinity Railway Express. It stops in Richland Hills, Hurst, CentrePort (an &quot;in-between&quot; development), and Irving.<br>* Downtown Fort Worth is linked to D/FW Airport by TEXRail, which also serves North Richland Hills, Haltom City, &amp; Grapevine in between. Grapevine has a lot of high-end touristy stuff, and there&#39;s shuttles there that connect to the TEXRail station.<br>* Fort Worth&#39;s transit, aside from the aforementioned rail lines, are buses and, in some districts, Via (which accepts bus passes). It&#39;s called Trinity Metro on this side.<br>* Dallas is DART, and has an extensive light-rail/bus/rideshare system that connects all corners of the city and most of the suburbs on that side (the ones that aren&#39;t in DART don&#39;t have much for tourists anyway). Plano basically <b>is</b> southern Collin County and is part of DART. If you wanna visit elsewhere in CC like McKinney, though, gonna have to Uber/Lyft or drive. Frisco is Collin County&#39;s Arlington.<br>* Denton County has DCTA, which links to both DART &amp; Trinity Metro via rail and bus, respectively, and serves most of SE &amp; Central Denton County (most anything a tourist&#39;d be interested in, it&#39;s there).<br>* The outlying areas/counties, while most do have transit options, still, for now, have yet to see much expansion to the &quot;quite alright&quot;, however. If you intend on visiting most of the lakes, for example... yeah, driving is by far the best option.<br><br>As with most places that aren&#39;t, like, Tokyo or Paris or New York City, rideshare/taxis will likely have to also play a factor in your time here if you go the transit route. Driving is still the &#39;best&#39; way, especially if you wanna hit a lot of places as a tourist quickly, although it does have its downsides (traffic, parking, etc). But the idea that this is still some wasteland for transit and that you HAVE to drive is just... not right anymore.",34,0,Network S.G.C.

4676,TMr7Ty064mM,"I lived in Dallas in 1978 and left in 1981 living with my grandfather when I was 15 years old. I recently took a trip back there and the city really grew. Especially the Plano area. I remember Plano Texas in 1978 was really a small town. It‚Äôs really grown as a city. Plus, when I lived there, it felt more like I was in a southwestern town. Most of the people were from there and spoke with a southern accent. Now, it doesn‚Äôt even feel like you‚Äôre in the southwest anymore with all the transplants from California and all over the place. The city of Dallas has changed a lot as have many of the cities. I think living in the United States, it doesn‚Äôt really matter where you live anymore, everything looks the same no matter what state you‚Äôre in. We have a Walmart, we have a Target, there‚Äôs a mall, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, Starbucks, Carrabbas and Subway, plenty of McDonald‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a plethora of strip malls and Denny‚Äôs along with Dairy Queen‚Äôs, we mustn‚Äôt forget our Dairy Queen‚Äôs. They are all over Texas. So, you see, it doesn‚Äôt really matter where you live, the United States is just one big country of fast food joints and Walmarts! That is the legacy of Americans.

It is many things to do here but it is by no means a vacation destination unless you like to shop. Dallas has some of the best shopping of any city I have ever been too including major cities like NYC and LA. and for every budget. The traffic here gets worse by the day so be prepared to do anything after morning or evening rush hour if you want to keep your stress in check. Fort Worth Downtown area is a better destination for tourist, sorry Dallas it is just the truth. Fort Worth Downtown has great restaurants and their downtown area has plenty of free parking and they have better festivals than Dallas. Dallas has better shopping and night life if that is your thing. As a local I can tell you that we have so many restaurants here that you are bound to find something to your liking,  my personal recommendation is for the best fried chicken Babes with several location is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten and I am an expert, it is close to Grandma than you can get without Grandma and Ojeidas is my favorite Tex-Mex again we literally have 100&#39;s of Tex-Mex places here so just ask a local and you have to get a Whataburger while you are here; a great burger from a fast food joint. Even though several commenters threw shade on some of the areas with minorities like Pleasant Grove which is were I grew up, you may want to take their advice if you are not familiar with certain parts of this city like any city, Dallas has some rough spots but overall I think its safer than many other large cities with a million plus population.

4832,TMr7Ty064mM,"GREAT VIDEO!! Totally nailed all the big stuff and yes anytime of year is fun to visit Dallas outside of June - August. (ugh!)<br>Being a local I can&#39;t resist posting some of my own additional Do&#39;s &amp; Don&#39;ts for tourists visiting Dallas/Ft. Worth:<br>1.  Don&#39;t let your guard down if you ride the Dallas transit rail.  Dallas has a growing problem (especially downtown) with criminal vagrancy and a lot of really crazy people wandering the streets and who ride the DART rail system and they WILL 100% make a scene demanding money or being threatening to you if you encounter one of them. Unfortunately that&#39;s just part of being a big city. If you are a tourist or on vacation and you choose to ride DART, do it in the daytime and stick with the crowd. Watch your wallets and phones and maintain your security level at all times.<br>2.  Uber is your friend! Do use local ride-share if you need to hop locations for something, they are quite good here.<br>3.  DO take what Mark said about the weather dangers seriously. He is right on. In the warmer months always keep one eye on the sky and seek shelter early if you detect dark clouds, lightening or warnings.  The hail storms here will put you in the hospital or worse if you get caught out in one. Also the sun as was mentioned in the summer the sun is lethal. You will get blistered in minutes on a hot sunny day, dehydrated or worse. Respect the sun here. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that one of the common events related to weather in DFW are power outages. Storms regularly cut power and if you&#39;re here during bad weather understand that it&#39;s pretty normal to lose power for a few hours. Be prepared.<br>4. Don&#39;t underestimate the size of DFW international airport if you are thinking of making a connecting flight. Give yourself plenty of time to go from one side of DFW to another. There are literally buses and trams that go between terminals because the terminals are so far apart. Keep in mind as well that DFW airport is almost 20 miles from downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth. You will need transportation to hop from the airport to either city center. <br>5.  DO try to visit the following local hidden gems:<br>* Old City Park - Southside of downtown Dallas (Lots of restored old prairie homes and buildings that show what Dallas was like 150 yrs ago)<br>* Frontiers of Flight Museum - South East corner of Love Field Dallas (Really cool aerospace museum with an apollo capsule)<br>* Snuffers restaurant in Rockwall - 30 miles east of Dallas in neighboring Rockwall TX, local eatery with succulent bar food overlooking Lake Ray Hubbard from up on a hill. The sunsets are awesome!<br>* Dr. Pepper Park in Frisco Tx, Triple A minor league ball park home of the Frisco Rough Riders baseball team - 20 Miles north of Dallas in Frisco Tx. See major league level players up close for dirt cheap prices before they get called up to the majors and enjoy the old fashioned ballpark experience. <br>* Lake Carolyn kayaks and paddleboards in Las Colinas (aka Irving), a calm and scenic urban waterway where for cheap money you can rent kayaks and paddleboards and explore the endless canals that wander through an upscale urban setting with tall buildings on either side of the canal. The man-made concrete lake is very safe, no power boats but lots of ducks and urban grottoes.<br>*  Fort Worth Museum of Science and History - Just a few blocks west of downtown Ft. Worth this natural science museum has major international city sized exhibits, an expansive children&#39;s activities area with interactive programs and lessons as well as probably the largest OMINIMAX theater in the country. The theater is round and domed but sits at a 30deg angle and every seat puts you literally inside the picture. <br>*  Historic downtown Grapevine Texas - 15 miles north and east of Ft. Worth (just west of DFW Airport) is the Texas equivalent of Main St. USA at Disneyworld. An old city downtown restored and always bustling with activities including street festivals, concerts, and every kind of celebration. Ride the old vintage railroad trains from Grapevine to the Ft.Worth stockyards and back.<br>*  Grab an upscale dinner at Reata restaurant in downtown Fort Worth.  - Steakhouse with a unique and picturesque rooftop dinning area. Great food anytime but go in the evening and wear your shiny shoes and really enjoy the atmosphere of the place.  Truly Fort Worth. <br>*  Go canoeing or kayaking in downtown Forth Worth at back woods or backwoods (can&#39;t remember the exact name) but they put you in the river downtown and its really scenic and fun. (Maybe if you go in July or August choose the night paddles because honestly no one goes outside in the heat of summer for anything unless it&#39;s an emergency. (see #3)<br>*  Finally if you really want to do something adventurous that lets you take it all in at once, check out Epic Helicopter Tours. They fly out of both Ft. Worth and North Dallas (Addison airport). Yeah, it&#39;s a little pricey per person but if you want something truly memorable that will hands-down be the highlight of your trip to DFW, whip out the credit card and don&#39;t look back. <br>6. DON&#39;T think you can take a day trip to Waco and be back before 3pm.  If you want to go visit Waco, devote a whole day and evening to that trip. There is so much to do and see in Waco, and it&#39;s farther away than you might realize.<br>7. Don&#39;t put a lot of effort or expectations into going to see Reunion Tower (the big ball tower in downtown Dallas).  As of 2021 it&#39;s pretty empty other than an observation deck. There is a bar and sometimes a restaurant up there but ask any local and they will tell you it&#39;s nothing to write home about. Yeah the view is neat but it&#39;s kind of like visiting a dying mall these days. Hyatt needs to do something with that space. It was a beautiful place back in the 80s. <br>8. FINALLY, Don&#39;t think you have to stay in the city to see cool stuff. If you&#39;ve had your fill of tourism fun in the megaopolis of Dallas and Forth Worth and are feeling the need for some wide open sky, or to experience that truly rugged Texas landscape, here is a little day trip for you that will not disappoint. Especially if you have kids. Drive south from the metroplex to Glen Rose Texas. (About 75 miles from the central tourist strip in Arlington or 1.5hr drive time) Glen Rose is very quaint and scenic but just outside of town is Dinosaur Valley State Park and it is probably one of the most popular parks in Texas. The clear waters of the Paluxy river have exposed numerous dinosaur footprints in the smooth flat rocks that line the bottom of the river. You can wade and explore for miles and the kids will get to splash and cool off. The state parks are very clean and well maintained. And the surrounding hills and cedar woods really satisfy that desire for western scenery.  If 75 miles is too far you can get a somewhat similar experience at Cedar Hill State Park just south and outside of Dallas. Rolling western hills and cedar woods minus the dinosaurs and hour drive. Cedar Hill can be crowded on weekends so plan accordingly. Or if you have some time on your hands and are feeling lucky, about an hour and a half (ish) north of the DFW area up Interstate I-35, just a mile across the Oklahoma line is Winstar Casino. It&#39;s a Vegas sized casino with all the expected games and fun. Not for kids, but if mom and dad are looking for some action while the kids spend the night with grandma and grandpa, it&#39;s a popular weekend destination for locals.",2,2,Groucho Grumbles

The mosquitos, unbearable heat + humidity, lack of open spaces in Texas (all land is owned by someone and private besides parks), traffic, backwards legislation that Texas govt passes to bring the state back to the 1800s (I&#39;m Independent not Democrat before anyone assumes something), and lack of access to real medical marijuana. The heat is bad. It could be 10pm and still be 98¬∞. The party scene, entertainment, and food scene in Austin is second to none. So if you can live with the above problems then new-Austin is for you.

5448,KzX9kJumv9A,"Allow me to break down Austin as someone who was born and raised there until I moved away for college in 2015. Austin is definitely NOT the glamorous city it&#39;s portrayed as in this video. Austin, itself, is very liberal but Texas as a whole, is a conservative republican state. My previous statement means basically there&#39;s a 98% chance you&#39;ll end up working for a racist/Trump supporter even in a liberal city like Austin. Secondly, cost of living in a one bedroom in Austin is $1900/month now. Minimum wage is STILL $7.25/hr. Texas doesn&#39;t care about none of its people (Austin currently is in stage 5 pandemic and they are operating at 100% capacity without mask mandate protocols like other states.) My family is still in Texas so I&#39;m quite up to date with everything. East Austin has heavy gentrification. Houses in Austin are no less than $450K. I don&#39;t know why Californians choose to move ONLY to Texas, there are other cheaper southern states you know.

In the Hill country surrounding SA, there are also many swimming holes, wineries, breweries &amp; bed/breakfast in small historic towns. Austin is an hour north and good for a day trip.

The city is adjacent to the barren and stony Franklin mountains. If you&#39;ve never been west of the Mississippi River, imagine the set for a Clint Eastwood western. The majority of the population is Latino, and many if not most people speak Spanish in public. There is a large Army base in the city with nearly 100,000 soldiers and support staff, according to some estimates. Texas sure does have a lot of military bases for one state.

El Paso also has the Franklin mountains state park for mountain lovers.<br>Corpus Christi is kinda crowded. Port Arkansas and Rockport are better, cleaner and less crowded. South Padre islands which are another 2 hours south from Corpus has some of the cleanest and best water in the state.<br>Big bend national park should have been number one. Guadalupe mountains national park is another must visit especially for hikers. Guadalupe peak in the park is the highest point in Texas. <br>State parks close to Amarillo are Palo duro state park and caprock canyons.<br>Houston and Dallas are cities full of culture<br>Austin is a beautiful city but the traffic is getting bad. <br>I live in San Antonio. The river wall ain‚Äôt that great. It‚Äôs over hyped. But does have many more parks compared to the other big cities. <br>Big bend national park is an international dark sky park and should have been number one. Fredericksburg should also have been much higher on the list (maybe number2) it does get very busy especially over weekends. Making it difficult to reserve a spot to dine",1,0,myron almeida

Like add an amusement park, do major construction &amp; better handle the traffic, revamp the sunrise mall that I heard was apparently closed down! Whatever the residents that‚Äôs are not very happy there want!",31,4,Christina C

This city is an example of a community arrested into submission. <br><br>These videos &quot;attempt&quot;  to lure people into these dangerous places.

Why does he think old people don&#39;t like music? I don&#39;t drink but that&#39;s a health choice, not an age choice. Lots of older people do drink.  Maybe what this guy is really saying is, &quot;Hey we don&#39;t want you old people crowding our scene.&quot; Shut up. I&#39;m going to watch the rest of the video, because he started out right in an area I really like.

7190,M6Gi3FRopO8,"It‚Äôs true, Americans have a right to travel enshrined in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution, which specifically states: ‚Äú...citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.‚Äù It was intended to protect out-of-state American civilians from being discriminated against as they travel from state to state.<br><br>It all comes down to whatever definitions the sovereign citizen decides to use. Sovereign Citizens believe because they refer to one who uses a conveyance to go from one place to another&quot;, and includes all those who use the highways as a matter of Right, because the phrase ‚Äòfor hire‚Äô never occurs.  Conversely, the term ‚Äúdriver‚Äù is defined as ‚Äúone employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon, or other vehicle,‚Äù and therefore ‚Äúit should be self-evident that this individual could not be ‚Äòtraveling‚Äô on a journey, but is using the road as a place of business.‚Äù Likewise, the terms ‚Äúautomobile‚Äù and ‚Äúmotor vehicle‚Äù denote special meaning. The word ‚Äòautomobile‚Äô connotes a pleasure vehicle designed for the transport of persons on highways,‚Äù and is private property in use for private purposes, whereas &#39;motor vehicle&#39; is defined in 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 31 as ‚Äúevery description of carriage or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used for commercial purposes on the highways in the transportation of passengers, passengers and property, or property or cargo.‚Äù <br><br>So sov cits have deduced that by admitting you are committing the act of &quot;driving&quot;, that you unwittingly place yourself in admiralty or commercial jurisdiction.  And as a sovereign being, you never need to surrender your rights and exchange them for privileges.<br><br>Travel is a personal right protected by the Constitution. Sovereign citizens argue that laws regarding driver‚Äôs licenses only apply to commercial operations, as no law can be made restricting travel. But - state laws requiring a license do not state anything about driving or traveling at all. For example, the law from the Michigan Vehicle Code Act of 1949, which describes those individuals seeking a license as: ‚Äúan applicant for an operator‚Äôs license or chauffeur‚Äôs license to operate a noncommercial motor vehicle.‚Äù  Driving is never mentioned as an activity - only the operation of a motor vehicle. <br><br>So you can walk, run, bike, or jog to your heart&#39;s desire, on public roads, freeway, and across state lines.  <br><br>But if you want to operate a motor vehicle, which is a several thousand pound machine capable of speeds of over 100 mph, you&#39;re gonna need a license to do so.",2,3,Sophie Katt

You find out about history that way. Also Allen&#39;s Landing used to be a popular spot at one time. The Port of Houston is another spot I traveled at one time. There are ships from all over the globe there. Just don&#39;t know how it is there these days. There is also a park in down town Houston but haven&#39;t been there in years.

How many cisterns are in the USA, that this is the only one open for tours?   That girl had a great voice.  I  wish she said how much water used to be in there, I understand what she said about not letting it go dry.  But it would have been cool to know how much they used to keep &quot;back in the day&quot;. I&#39;m bummed the print shop guy didn&#39;t let you run the presses that they usually do for their tour.  Especially since it seemed like a private tour, and Tom mentioned that he was in the printing business.

Dallas people are more showy, Houston people more humble and funny. Houston is more international and has a lot of Cajun food. Both are basically flat but Houston has a lot of palm trees. The big problem with Houston is that there are enormous areas of ghettos all over and then super rich neighborhoods isolated. Dallas seems more level economically. You can drive 20, 25 miles in Houston and it&#39;s some of the roughest looking ghetto you can see.",5,1,Heidi

The big problem with Houston is that there are enormous areas of ghettos all over and then super rich neighborhoods isolated. Dallas seems more level economically.

There was a lady who lived there who ran a kind of cafe in her kitchen. At that time there was no other place to eat in town. My parents car was a 1958 Borgward.

One of my favorite memories was  that there was no cold beer sold in Impact. The beer companies would deliver beer by the pallet and set it on the showroom floor and then we would sell a styrofoam cooler and ice. I used to order a train car of coolers from Dart every month just for Impact.  Also had three HUGE ice machines and three guys that did nothing except bag ice for sale.

I stressed that if we are moved to please keep us farther away from the clubhouse or playground since my 91 year old father retires early and gets up late.

Pop was a wildcatter and took lots of risks. He found his next field I think in Oklahoma. And needed bug money. So he sold the ET field to H L Hunt who was the father of Lamar Hunt.

No doubt it‚Äôs great to see the activity of people milling around on the streets, it proves that a city is relaxed, comfortable and well loved by it‚Äôs residents and visitors alike. Even coming across as safe, which these days, is an incredible feat for any major metropolitan area. The sights, the spontaneity, the history‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say you have earned a great big Texas sized gold star for this one! <br><br>Sidebar- You weren‚Äôt far from the Buckner Home, just east of Dallas, which has some great history dating back to the late 1800‚Äôs. My dad was raised there, after being the last of ten children to be left on the steps due to his family losing their farm in the 1930‚Äôs during the Dust Bowl era‚Ä¶ Grapes of Wrath and all that. They saved many many children from lives of ruin, and are still in service to this day. <br><br>There is something remarkable about having lifelong mental images of places unseen, changed forever. Such is the case in discovering that Texas is an easy state to love, once you get to know it. I couldn‚Äôt be more glad to say that adding this to the past episodes you‚Äôve done such as Austin, Huston and San Antonio, helps to relinquish past opinions based on, well, other people‚Äôs opinions. Your style can launch a brain into receiving new insights, perspectives and inspiration not commonly found amongst the sea of creators out there. Often attempted, seldom executed. <br><br>Thank you, for taking the time to read and appreciate every single expression of gratitude from your audience.

10174,nhCtEZuBNj4,"Dylan, Amtrak is refurbishing the entire fleet of Superliners. Since Amtrak has only so many Sightseeing Lounges and Diners in their fleet, those stolen from services to do the refurbishments have come from the Texas Eagle/Capitol Limited shared train sets. Amtrak decided that the more scenic routes deserve the Sightseeing Lounges during the refurbishent. After the entire fleet is done the Sightseeing Lounges will return to the Eagle/Capitol Limited shared transits. More than a decade ago Amtrak had a shortage of Superliner Diners, and converted several of their abundant Superliner coaches to this Cross Country Cafe car serving the Diner meals. Since the pandemic the only Superliner trains that have not reverted back to traditional dining are these Cross Country Cafe cars on the Eagle/Capitol Limited shared train sets. Amtrak is so short on Diners, they are using the two  extra Cross Country Cafe cars to replace Diners requiring maintenance on the other trains. So it is possible to see a Cross Country Cafe car on another train operating Superliners at any given time. Amtrak said they were going to return traditional dining to all of their trains with diners before the end of the year, but an exact date has not been announced, as yet....",0,1,Ron Clark

10231,nhCtEZuBNj4,Thanks for taking this train so that I don&#39;t have to. I have done most of Amtrak&#39;s routes including discontinued routes you would have liked. A small correction: that &quot;Colorado river&quot; you crossed in Texas is not the one that divides California from Arizona after coming through the Grand Canyon out of Utah and the state by that name. You did cross that bigger river getting to Yuma. The Texas Colorado flows in the other direction from the Rockies eastward to the Gulf of Mexico at Matagordo.
