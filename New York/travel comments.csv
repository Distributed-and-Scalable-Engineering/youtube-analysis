2,1JJfWnAryrM,"For people who love history, I recommend a guided tour of the Brooklyn Bridge.  I did that last year, and the tour guide was excellent.     Learning of the history behind the Brooklyn Bridge from what it was like before it was built and all the suffering that went into building it made the experience of walk so meaningful to me.     The tour company was Inside-Out.",103,4,2000konnie
3,1JJfWnAryrM,"John - I just returned from a two week graduation celebration trip (my daughter from UCLA) to NYC. She has always wanted to go there!  I had a lot of time and fun in reviewing probably all of your videos and a bunch of the Traveling Clatt as well. Thanks a million for making and posting those videos - we packed so much into our time there and based much of what we did on the information you provided through your videos. We felt like it was a trip we will never forget and boldly explored NYC with confidence!  Thanks again... even though the trip has ended I know I‚Äôll still watch your posts (we actually left a couple things undone for next trip). Regards, Steve.",27,0,Steve Ralston
4,1JJfWnAryrM,"I cannot even tell you how much your videos helped.  We just got back to small town Indiana from the big Apple.  After watching your videos I totally felt like we did NYC right!  Went to Chelsea got them tacos from Numero Uno!  Learned the subway system, Brooklyn Bagel, walked the Brooklyn Bridge, ate at off the path restaurants.  Even though our hotel was on Times Square we ventured out and didn‚Äôt stay confined to the tourist stuff.  Thank you a thousand times man.  Between you and ‚ÄúClatt‚Äù I felt like I just knew what I was doing!",13,0,aaron oyler
5,1JJfWnAryrM,"Keep up the great videos! As someone wanting to visit,  I really like how you recommend &quot;touristy&quot; places anyway because they&#39;re just a fun experience &quot;at least once&quot;. Perfect mix of recognizing newbie excitement and combining it with your local insight!! Thanks!!!!!! Really glad I found your channel!",17,0,Karoline Keffer
6,1JJfWnAryrM,"Thanks John!  Everything you show us is awesome.  What I‚Äôd love to see is your spin on walking food/sites itineraries concentrated in one area and doable in 3-4 hours.  I know there are walking tours out there, but your recommendations with visuals of just the outside of landmarks would be fantastic!  I‚Äôve done walking tours w companies before (and they are great) but it‚Äôs for set times and dates ~ not necessarily what works with ours.",1,0,MySweetLoves

8,1JJfWnAryrM,"I couldn&#39;t agree more! Especially transit museum was definitely my favourite, and without your videos I&#39;d probably miss it.<br>If I&#39;d expand this list, I would add:<br>1. Go for a helicopter ride. Yes, it costs, but you won&#39;t regret it.<br>2. Go for a cruise on a sailing boat. Some of them even have live music!<br>3. Visit Bay Ridge in Brooklyn. By far my favourite neighbourhood, simply stunning!<br>4. Go to Coney Island. The beach is amazing(I&#39;m from Greece so I have high standards on beaches), and there&#39;s also NY aquarium nearby, as well as a luna park and nice spots for food and drink.<br>5. Visit NY Library. Really beautiful and FREE!<br>6. Visit National Museum of American Indian. Really nice museum with a few cool activities, also free!!!<br>7. If you&#39;re into sports, madison square garden is a must see!<br>8. Roam around Washington Heights. Really cool neighbourhood that also has the sylvan terrace, which is simply amazing.<br><br><br>But please people don&#39;t stick to only such lists, just go out and explore the city!",47,2,keyser soze

19,1JJfWnAryrM,"Thank you for this video, very well thought out and will benefit tons of people.  You really nailed it.  As someone from NJ, I&#39;m still in awe of Times Square and how there&#39;s really nothing like it in the world (really the only thing as close is some areas in Tokyo).  If you&#39;re list were longer, I would include Coney Island (although its a different borough), as well as Chinatown (particularly the area near Doyers), and Wall Street/Trinity Church area (even though the last time I was there, there was some really ugly scaffolding that blocked the view of Trinity Church from Wall Street.)",8,1,Mark A.

Also, I would suggest Little Italy (I&#39;ve been gone for 5 years now, but pretty sure it&#39;s still a thing) The memorial, please be respectful and yes, highly recommend.

27,1JJfWnAryrM,I always recommend  (if they don&#39;t stay in brooklyn) to go first to brooklyn with the subway before going on to the brooklyn bridge.

48,1JJfWnAryrM,"I&#39;ve lived in New York for 3/4 of a century. Never been to the Lady in the harbor, the Empire state bldg., nor was I ever foolish enough to tour Central Park (Did go through it in a  horse and buggy, about 50 years ago.) You can go to the stables and rent a horse in Manhattan and ride it on legal horse paths. You can go to the Cloisters or grant&#39;s tomb and say thanks to him - few people ever go. Go to Riverdale in the Bronx or the BAM in Brooklyn - Coney island. If you have a spare few hundred dollars, sure, go to a broadway play once in your life. I did that back in 1955. Haven&#39;t been back. Parking alone is $50, Tickets are hundreds and hundreds and if you want to have dinner you&#39;ll pay a fortune for bad food. What he says about the village is true, wander around there check out the layout and the people and the architecture. Ask somebody where the MEWS are - these are hidden, very secret streets and people LIVE there. Stay a week just to see the museums - I used to go every weekend in the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s. Have a steak at the Old Homestead on 13th street. and go to Katz&#39;s deli  on Houston street for a once in a lifetime dining experience. Yeah, do Times Square at night. But if you want the skinny, go at 8 a.m. on a Sunday. Never set foot on Staten Island. I never did.",16,0,Stephen Ryder

58,1JJfWnAryrM,Hey John....thanks for all the tips.   We just got back from a 4 day trip to NYC and your tips were golden.   We did see a show as well that was out of this world called &quot;The show that goes wrong&quot; at New World Stages on 50th (I believe) and it was non-stop laughs from start to finish..... I strongly recommend it as a less expensive way to see an amazing show in NYC.    Thought you may want to check it out as an option for a future video.   Our family of 4 got discounted tickets on Groupon for $240 all in.  This theatre also has multiple other shows in multiple theatres at the same location.      I believe its an off broadway show.  thx,0,0,Acacio A

156,1JJfWnAryrM,"Listen to this guy.  He knows what he is talking about.  If I‚Äôd add anything, I add this: start at the battery and walk.... walk upwards through all the neighborhoods, including Chinatown and Soho, and all the way to the upper east or west side to one if the museums.  NYC is an aggregation of neighborhoods, and the bast way to see them is to walk them with a subway stop here and there.<br><br>Good advice here if limited in time.  Of course, one can never leave Manhattan (and many never do) and live a remarkable life.  Short on theme?  His advice is sound.  One note: many of the major museums are free.  The charge you will see is discretionary.  Simply pay what you can afford,, and go.  One often doesn‚Äôt have to pay the price suggested.  It‚Äôs a suggestion, not mandatory. Read the fine print at admissions.  Offer $5 and off you go.",4,0,wallybeep

Also recommended,  if you are going to be doing multiple activities throughout your trip go ahead and get a weekly metro card. Even if you are here for two days.

191,1JJfWnAryrM,"Here are 10 more New York City great Dos in addition to John&#39;s great recommendations:<br>1.   To see celebrities in person go to the corner of 53 street and Broadway in Manhattan and go north a few feet up 53 street around 4:30 pm Monday to Fridays (only when the Stephen Colbert Show is taping because sometimes the show is on vacation or is off for a day) and stand behind police barricades that will be there.  Then, you&#39;ll see the celebrities coming in between 5pm and 6pm across the street from where you&#39;ll be standing.  Then, when the celebrities finish being on the show they will come out of that side entrance to leave.  Many celebs when they are leaving (not when they first arrive) will walk up to the fans and take selfies and shake hands with you.  The celebs will walk up to you between 6pm and 45 minutes after that.  But, you have to be there early before the fans area fills up. <br><br>2.   You can also see celebrity guests going to The Jimmy Fallon Show and Seth Meyer Show and if you&#39;re lucky Saturday Night Live Show inside 30 Rockerfeller Center (yes that&#39;s the same building that the TV show 30 Rock is based on with Tina Fey).  That is near the corner of 50 Street and Avenue Of The Americas and try to be there around 5pm inside the lobby and just ask someone which is the elevator to go to The Jimmy Fallon Show.  Then just stand in that elevator side where there is a guard that will not let you in that the elevator side.  But, you can stand just outside the elevator side. <br><br>3.   If you want to see a specific celebrity that is staring in a Broadway stage show, go to that theater early (especially on weekdays) and ask one of the theater employees where is the side entrance (not the main entrance) where the celebrities come in through and at what time do they arrive which can vary since some celebs come in hours before to put on make-up or costumes for the show.  Others don&#39;t. <br><br>4.   If you are a fan of basball (The Yankees, The Mets), you can find out when they are in town playing in their stadium and get tickets for The Yankees (in The Bronx) taking the 4 train to 161 Street or for The Mets to the stop called Citi Field on the 7 train.  This way you can see some of the most famous athletes.<br><br>5.  If you want to see a free live music concert from the top singers in the world, during the summer NBC TV network has free concerts near the ice rink in a court yard area in between buildings away from traffic in Rockefeller Center.  These shows are presented by The Today Show in the morning during weekdays.  Check listings to see when and who will be performing.<br><br>6.  If you want to see celebrities being interviewed check 92 Y celebrity interviews on YouTube to get an idea of how that place is and call that place by Googling it to find out the upcoming schedule of future celebrity interviews.<br><br>7.  If you are a Seinfeld fan, there is a Seinfeld bus tour that will take you to the famous real places mentioned on the Seinfeld Show.  Google it.<br><br>8.  If you want to go to the actual dive bar where Lady Gaga hangs out (and used to perform at before she became famous) go to 123 Rivingston Street in The Lower East Side of Manhattan.  Google Map it.<br><br>9.  If you are a fan of old Jazz and of Louis Armstrong, just Google Louis Armstrong house museum which is in Queens, New York across the river from Manhattan to actually walk around Louis house inside and see and touch his furniture which is still there the way he left it when he died. <br><br>10.  If you want to visit the graves of some of the most famous celebrities in the history of this planet, just search on YouTube famous celebrity graves in New York City and look at those videos and pick which celebrity graves you want to see and just Google Map each individual cemetery that has those graves.  Google at what time each cemetery opens and closes and go early to spend a quiet peaceful day walking around those iconic tomb stones.<br><br>I hope my recommendations helped some of you.  Remember to stay away from expensive overpriced places.  Some of the best food in NYC are in ethnic neighborhoods like China Town in Manhattan, Little Italy on Mulberry street, the Latin Neighborhood of Washington Heights in Manhattan, the Russian neighborhood of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and some hot spots like Ethiopian Food, Indian Food, Thai Food, and Philippines Food areas throughout the city.

270,1JJfWnAryrM,"Ok everyone my man did a good job but he might not have some of the native knowledge you need to know. First and foremost, his pizza recommendations are totally wrong and tourists traps. Johns on bleeker, joes on 7th. Avoid dollar slices they‚Äôre great on a budget but you‚Äôre visiting, get the good stuff. In Brooklyn Difaras is best all NYC but its deep in Brooklyn, otherwise Lucalis is amazing in iconic neighborhood of carrol gardens Brooklyn. Brooklyn. You must spend at least 2 days in Brooklyn alone there‚Äôs just as much to do as in the city (Manhattan). You‚Äôre gonna want to see iconic Coney Island and get your Nathans hot dog, if you‚Äôre visiting during the summer you simply can‚Äôt pass on Coney Island. South Brooklyn (near Brooklyn bridge) is amazing and has some of the best restaurants in NY. If in season go to the Bronx for a Yankees game then arthur avenue after for dinner thats the real little Italy. <br>Here‚Äôs the real pro tips:<br>1. Walk fast on busy streets or you‚Äôll see why we have a reputation (thats not true at all) for being rude, if you‚Äôre walking slow your actually the one being rude. <br>2. This ONLY applies in busy areas during the rush. Don‚Äôt make eye contact or smile at strangers, especially on the subway. Again this is rude.<br>3. If in a busy deli/store/pizzeria no small talk, the words please and thank you are meaningless. Give your order, get out the way, have your payment ready. Holding up the flow is again rude, and the cashier probably deals with thousands of people a day, they just cant give everyone attention.<br>4. Avoid staten island, its a dump (no really it is) and the people there are terrible.<br><br>Basically go by the old saying ‚Äúwhen in rome, do as the romans do‚Äù NYC is Rome.<br>Don‚Äôt be nervous, believe me we‚Äôre some of the friendliest people in the world despite what you heard. You need directions ask somebody (just not someone walking fast with their head down) you‚Äôll get them, detailed with patience, and probably followed by a recommendation. Our night life is unmatched, make friends but don‚Äôt trust anyone if thats makes sense. Until you actually get to know them. It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre untrustworthy it‚Äôs just that there are a lot of scams.<br>Remember its a city of 8.5 million people and has as many as 15 even 20 million on a given day with commuters and tourists. Some are gonna be jerkoffs, but most are cool. We‚Äôre a city made up of every walk of life, and we pretty much all get along. We wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. In NYC it doesn‚Äôt matter where you‚Äôre from/ what you believe, its how you act.<br>Follow my advice and the videos you‚Äôll have the time of your life! After all, it‚Äôs the greatest city in the world.",33,2,Garrus_Vakarian718

It&#39;s been 100 years! Pizza has changed with the american tradition and flavors. So pizza in usa is not the same as here! It&#39;s no sense that pizza is worst in italy that is the birth country of it!! Let me tell you that if you are sure of it, maybe that&#39;s because you never ever have tried the real italian pizza, here. So let&#39;s talk about this when you will have tried. <br>You will objectively see how different is the recipe in usa the the original one",0,0,Gaia Cigna

Greenwich Village wasn&#39;t mentioned, which is wonderful neighborhood, full of great restaurants and shops, and in a part of the city with no skyscrapers.

I did a photography tour which was great and got some awesome shots of Grand Central, NY public library and Times Square. I was so bored at the museums compared to Paris&#39;.

Second is the Empire State Building, mostly because it&#39;s so iconic, it has great views at nighttime too, the fence is a bit in the way for photos. Only then would come One World Trade Center, it&#39;s definitely the cleanest, and in general good for photos during bad weather, but has no outdoor area. The worst was &quot;The Edge&quot;, I would only go there early in the morning, since people lean on the glass, and it gets dirty quickly, making it hard to take good pictures.

I enjoy the pizza, tacos, Halal, Chinese, Italian etc..<br>3) Coney Island. Takes around 1 hour to get to Coney Island beach via the subway from Manhattan. I like to just relax, feel the sun and breeze and listen to the waves crash. <br>4) Staten Island Ferry. Free Ferry that travels between lower Manhattan and Staten Island with great views of the city and statue of liberty, going at night time is the best. <br>5) Governor&#39;s Island. You can take a ferry here from the same terminal as Staten Island Ferry. This is a small getaway island just south of Manhattan with parks, fields, playgrounds, trails, views, hammocks and more.<br>6) Visit Times Square at night<br>7) Walk down 5th ave and see all the fancy stores/shopping",4,2,MMA LIFE

2039,MtCMtC50gwY,"At the time of its European discovery in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, the region was inhabited by around 5000 natives of the Lenape tribe. This Italian explorer in the service of the French crown called it Nouvelle Angoul√™me (New Angoul√™me) . The European installation began in 1614 in the hands of the Dutch and in 1626, the head of the colony, Peter Minuit, bought the island of Manhattan to the Lenape (the legend, now refuted, says that glass beads worth 24 dollars). The place would be renamed Nieuw Amsterdam and would specialize in the fur trade.14 In 1664, the English conquered the city and renamed it New York in honor of the Duke of York and Albany.15 At the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch gained control of Suriname, in exchange for the British controlling New Amsterdam.

2074,MtCMtC50gwY,"I just visited NYC and disappointment is the kindest word I could use . Of all the major cities in the world it is by far one of the dirtiest and noisiest , the infrastructure such as roads , subway , bridges etc are crumbing . They could film the living dead there¬†without special affects , it is also inhabited by people who&#39;s manners are comparable with their ability to empty their bins ( non existent ) and that&#39;s the hotel staff as for their taxi drivers !! lol DON&#39;T USE THEM , the most comical aspect about the NY service industry is they expect to be tipped for going out of their way not to be helpful . There are more homeless people there then in¬†Calcutta and you are expected to produce ID after 8pm in your over priced hotels . Please don&#39;t think i&#39;m anti- USA because I find Florida , California and Vegas beautiful and¬†inhabited by some of the most decent people on God&#39;s Earth just don&#39;t expect all America¬†to be¬†the same .",17,20,homan2329

Unless you want to get a good meal or taste of the asian culture there, then there&#39;s really no point in going. Some museums such as the Natural History Museum, are VERY crowded and by that, I mean you can&#39;t barely walk through the entrance. Don&#39;t even mention the lines- buy your tickets as early as possible! On a summer weekend, the line usually measures up to two blocks. I highly recommend Time Square. It&#39;s a huge tourist attraction anyway, and it is the PERFECT place to see a broadway show! The broadway shows in New York are superlative.",0,0,Joelle Lim

2500,MtCMtC50gwY,"script of the video, you&#39;re welcome :<br><br>New York is situated in the Northeast region of the United States of America.<br>Over eight million call the Big Apple home, and the city attracts up to fifty million visitors a year.<br><br>Ever since the Colonists arrived in 1624, New York has been continuously shaped by the waves of immigrants drawn here by the promise of hope, and liberty.<br>Every newcomer arrived with a cultural suitcase that contributed to the sounds, tastes and textures of New York.<br>But it is their dreams which built the city. A city like no other!<br><br>New York touches not only the heavens with its mystic skyline, its influence radiates to every corner of the globe. Every street it seems, is familiar through documentary, movie and song.<br>New York straightforward grid system makes it an easy city to explore by foot, taxi, or its subway, which just like the city, never sleeps!<br><br>In Manhattan‚Äôs Midtown, you‚Äôll find many of The Big Apple‚Äôs most iconic symbols.<br>The Art Deco-designed Empire State Building is one of the most impressive and endearing skyscrapers ever created.<br>The skyline may have grown up around it, but the view from the 102nd floor is as breathtaking today as it was when it first opened in 1931.<br><br>New York has always been a place where ‚Äúwhen the going got tough, the tough got going‚Äù.<br>The Rockefeller Center, a visionary city within a city, rose during the darkest days of the Great Depression. Today, it‚Äôs still a place of creativity, inspiration and even more incredible views of the city.<br><br>Closer to earth is Grand Central Terminal. Step in the Main Concourse, and feel the echo of every tearful farewell and joyous greeting throughout the station‚Äôs history. <br><br>New York has always been the gateway to the Land of the Free, but it is also the city of the spree, the shopping spree! This city is shopaholic heaven, and Fifth Avenue with the eye-popping window displays is the high temple of the retail world.<br><br>Times Square, one of the most visited tourist attractions on the planet. Stand here on the corner of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and you stand at the crossroads of the world. It‚Äôs also a place to snap up a half-price ticket to a Broadway show.<br><br>New York has been blessed with generous civic spaces. But there is no greater chill-out space in the Big Apple than Central Park, a beautiful 850-acre network of meadows and lakes. This is the place where New Yorkers come to rest, romance, and express themselves. <br><br>Over the decades many New Yorkers made it big, and much of that fabulous wealth was reinvested into collecting some of the greatest artworks on the planet. Nowadays, much of this art is available for everyone to enjoy. A walk through The Metropolitan Museum of Art is a walk through 5000 years of humankind‚Äôs greatest creative moments.<br><br>The Frank Lloyd Wright designed-Guggenheim is a different kind of walk, one which spirals ever-upward through a dizzying collection of 20th and 21st Century masterpieces.<br><br>Newcomers to NY spend much of their time looking skyward, but since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, a new attraction gives locals and visitors a chance to pause and bow their heads. The Reflecting Absence memorial and museum honors the 3000 people who lost their lives on that darkest of September days. <br>New York resonates with the sounds of over 800 language groups, and nothing epitomizes this diversity like the city‚Äôs neighborhoods. Little Italy packs all the tastes and flavors of Italy into just a couple of streets, while Soho attracts cool cats and well-heeled bohemians form all over the world.<br>A few streets away, Greenwich Village proudly retains the caf√©s and bars where creative residents like Bob Dylan first performed before becoming American icons. And then there are the boroughs. <br>Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to the melting pot of Brooklyn. With its own distinctive neighborhoods, museums, open spaces, and who could forget Coney Island! <br>So welcome to New York City, The Big Apple. We‚Äôve only just given you a bite-sized taste of what this incredible city has to offer. But if you‚Äôve got an appetite for the very best things that life has to offer, this is the destination for you there‚Äôs enough to feast on here for a lifetime!",0,0,Justine Guichard

My swamp ass was so bad, and I had a brown crayon to make things worse. A brown crayon is when you have a turtle head that won&#39;t go away.  This causes an everlasting brown streak on the toilet paper, no matter how many times you wipe.  I sharted at Katz&#39; deli and had to use my order ticket to wipe the shplatter (shit splatter).

2694,MtCMtC50gwY,HERE IS HOW TO BE LIKE A NEW YORKER<br>¬†-Don&#39;t wear I LOVE NY SHIRTS.<br>-Where comfortable and fashionable clothes that you would usually wear.<br>-Don&#39;t stare at people.<br>-Don&#39;t walk with an electrical device out. <br>-use the crosswalk on red lights (it saves time and its really not that dangerous)<br>-Ignore the homeless people. They are just gonna use the money they have to get some of DAT booze!<br>-Buy food from street vendors. The food is actually really good.<br>-Don&#39;t hesitate or stop on the middle of the sidewalk<br>-Know how to hail a cab. step off the curb and put your hand up.<br>-Buy some cheap stuff from Chinatown.<br>-NEVER EVER EVER use underground/indoor parking lots. THEY COST A FORTUNE and you could just find a regular parking spaces for FREE!<br>-Be aggressive when looking for a parking space.<br>-Never use buses. They are slow(they stop every block and often get stuck in traffic).<br>-Know where you are going.<br>-Don&#39;t just stand in the middle of Times Square.<br>-Be patient when in a traffic jam. (AT least its better than LA! Holy shit that is pure hell!)<br>-Take the subway if possible.<br>-Take off you&#39;re sweater/jacket in the subway (its underground and really hot).<br>-Don&#39;t complain about high prices of food and tip nicely.<br>-Avoid nasty neighborhoods (AKA the BRONX! okay im bein kinda racist but theres a lot of blacks there).<br>-Lock your car and hide valuables.<br>-Walk quickly and go with the flow.<br>-and lastly... ENJOY YOUR STAY<br><br>THESE ARE MY TIPS FROM A NEW YORKER (ME) BORN AND RAISED IN THE BIG CITY!,148,24,Bob Jones

3225,PUcg0XBqxBs,"Great video! I would say that sometimes you do need to have some extra cash on hand for tips, bodegas, buskers, ice cream/hot dogs in Central Park, street vendors etc. Some places only take cash. Also, about hotels - if you are planning to do sightseeing mostly in Manhattan, I would rather pony up the extra money to stay in Manhattan and be able to walk, explore and be closer to the sights I want to see on my time instead of staying somewhere in the outer boroughs just for the cheaper hotel ...you can have the best intentions about taking trains wherever you need to go during the day and at night, but if you happen to have a few late nights out, safety can be a concern and if you&#39;re not quite sure about taking the subway, you will be taking cabs/Lyfts/Ubers back to your hotel in the outer boroughs and that cost can add up (and take up time, too).",4,0,Lacey r_83

3229,PUcg0XBqxBs,"Honestly when it comes to safety and crime‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs more so common sense.

I found the Subway easy to get around (apart from Fulton street, but that&#39;s a long conversation). We stayed in Upper West side and had a supermarket across the road (well Broadway) with a deli and we were able to get something for dinner there. Saved us a lot of money.

So far I purchased tickets for The Rockettes Christmas Spectacular Show and a 4 hour Dyer Heights tour (Christmas day..kinda figured that would be a good day since some things may be closed and it&#39;ll give us a little break as we chill for a bit.) I found an Airbnb right by Times Square with all the action. I got it just in time too. All of my &quot;hearted&quot; pads skyrocketed considerably before the end of April. We have both been to NYC once but this trip is Christmas focused. I&#39;ve been investigating like nuts and plan to utilize your video to get from LaGuardia to our Airbnb. There&#39;s only two other things I plan to purchase tickets for...ice skating and I think we&#39;re gonna go with The Edge. One World Observatory sounds great for all the obvious reasons but towering over all of NYC didn&#39;t seem as cool as kinda being eye to eye. I like the see through floor but the other seems intriguing as well. I want to book tickets for dusk. I almost bought tx last night but I held off so I could see what the distance is between our temporary NYC home and where the Dyer Heights tour ends. I&#39;m thinking Christmas night may be the time to go after the tour which is scheduled to end at 8. Any thoughts on this? And any other suggestions that I should look into or book? Btw, my daughter will be 15 in June so she&#39;s at a great age to be adventurous with. Oh and we plan to definitely ride the Staten Island ferry. There&#39;s other good tour guides I&#39;ve checked out but I feel most comfortable with your videos and one other lady...the dudes are ok but I&#39;m sticking with the ladies! üíú<br><br>Thanks so much for your insightful, helpful videos. üíúüéÑüíú",5,1,Heidi Krummert

3250,PUcg0XBqxBs,"In terms of saving money on accommodation, I cant emphasise how much cheaper staying in an AirBnB is. It&#39;s about  10% the nightly cost of a hotel. You can find them in Brooklyn, Upper Manhattan and New Jersey. Yes you have to commute, but it&#39;s like 10-30 minutes max by bus!!

I&#39;ve seen so many guides that say &quot;bring cash, you must have cash, loads of places don&#39;t take cards&quot; but I have a travel credit card that has zero fees on spending and cash withdrawal. Plus it gives you the best rate you can get on purchases and cash as you get the daily Mastercard rate. <br><br>I still feel though that I do need to have some Dollars on me when I arrive at Christmas, not sure how much to bring though as it will be at a less favourable exchange rate most likely. $300-$500 perhaps?

3286,PUcg0XBqxBs,"Just come back from there. New York was somewhat disappointing, talking about the city itself. It was lovely to be away for a few days and we enjoyed it but we found New York itself has gone downhill certainly since we were last there in 2011. It‚Äôs super expensive now, on a par with central London prices, if not more! And when you add on the required tip for practically everything it really adds up. The tip culture is something I don‚Äôt care for, because it‚Äôs expected at not at the discretion of the paying customer. Even if you leave what they deem to be the wrong amounts of tip in other words not enough, they make that known in no uncertain terms! Not nice. Minimum tip they expect is 20%, and up to 30% in some instances. That sort of extra on top of already inflated prices, not helped by the poor exchange rate makes it extremely expensive. <br>We also found the streets very dirty and marijuana has now been legalised so every street corner stinks of the stuff! Not pleasant. <br>The subway is an experience in itself, full of deranged weirdos. A lot of very threatening and intimidating people on the platforms and trains i have to say. I never feel frightened on the London Underground but I did in NYC. I‚Äôm afraid New York has gone back to where it was in the 1980s in my view. <br>I‚Äôve painted a very bleak picture but that said we still nonetheless had a nice time and enjoyed some wonderful food and got to see a play and did a little shopping etc so we‚Äôre still glad we went but shan‚Äôt be rushing back anytime soon. Will try other US cities in future.",1,0,Robbie Ross

Plus the trees, shrubs are nicer in the summer.  Times Square also I would say is better in the summer because it is not cold and people are more willing to relax and hang out.  Also, the Charging Bull statue is literally right next to Battery Park which IS beautiful in the Fall and has great views of the Statue of Liberty.  Also, Rockefeller Center is iconic so I don&#39;t think it was a bad choice but if you have more time, Bryant Park and Union Square Park are also really great in the late fall/winter.",0,0,D G

Day 2 start with breakfast at a bagel place with a smear and some smoked salmon, go to the Statue of Liberty with Ellis island, head back to Chinatown for lunch (I pick nom wah tea house for dim sum), explore Chinatown a bit with little Italy next block, head to Chelsea for the art scene, eat a entire pizza at Lombardi‚Äôs for dinner, finally head to times square to explore at night and enjoy the three minute art displays near midnight on the screens. Day 3 try to find a diner nearby and eat a decent breakfast, head to DUMBO or Coney Island for a bit of exploring, go down to Wall Street to admire the stock exchange, go to Eataly by Madison square park as it‚Äôs a giant food hall for a good lunch, try shopping at Macy‚Äôs or try to find stores you like, for dinner try little Italy as most of the area is quite good.

Check out some of the food and support the black-owned businesses there, go to East Harlem and check out some of the latino culture there. Then get a citibike and enter Central park through 110th Street and bike down the length of the park. Check out the turtle pond. Go to the &quot;Imagine&quot; memorial and hear the buskers playing beatles songs. Check out the Dakota building where John Lennon was shot.

As a local, I always warn people that you will not be able to see everything in one trip‚Ä¶ or two‚Ä¶ or three even. üòÖ Hey, I still haven‚Äôt even been to the Edge or done a helicopter tour. The city can be overwhelming if you try to do too much so I recommend you pick a few things that are scattered about so you can spend a day in different parts of the city including boroughs other than Manhattan. Leave time in your schedule to be spontaneous or spend more time in a place you like. Depending on how much of it you wanted to see or how many things you‚Äôd wanted to do, you could easily spend a whole 3 days in central park alone and still not see everything in it!! I agree that the NY Pass seems like a good deal especially if you want to do general touristy things but still see a decent amount of the city‚Ä¶ but after that I‚Äôd try to avoid doing too many of those things because they don‚Äôt really give you a feel for what the city‚Äôs really like as the activities included are tourist activities in touristy areas‚Ä¶ areas which locals generally try to avoid. üòÖ",0,1,word 2

4026,mWzogob2cq0,"As a native New Yorker, I&#39;m always curious what you tell first time visitors. One tip on hailing a cab, do NOT step out into the street, stand on the edge of the curb and put you hand up. Many people step out into the street and that is dangerous. As for pizza, GREAT suggestion regarding Patsy&#39;s in Harlem. Not only is it the ONLY Patsy&#39;s location worth visiting, they have several, but the one in Harlem, on 1st Avenue, was an inspiration for the restaurant scene in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, check out the men&#39;s room, seriously. There&#39;s also a terrific little pizza place across the street from the theater that shows &quot;Hamilton&quot;. As for Times Square, avoid it. For food, you can find so many wonderful options 2 blocks west on 9th Avenue. Lately I&#39;ve been eating my way down that street and the choices are endless, though for basic and consistently great food, we stop at Mom&#39;s. For another hot dog vendor, there&#39;s a guy in front of the Metropolitan museum that is great. He&#39;s a veteran and grills his dogs, instead of boiling them. I know, getting long winded here..one last thing. Walking the Brooklyn Bridge. YES! Do it!! But go from Manhattan to Brooklyn, then walk over to the nearby Manhattan Bridge and underneath is an amazing food court with some iconic choices, or walk a few blocks up Flatbush Avenue Extension to the original Juniors, great food and the best cheesecake you&#39;ll ever have. Then walk back. Give it a few hours, walking in NYC is the best way to get around!! Be safe!",108,12,Brad Marcus
4027,mWzogob2cq0,"Some great tips! I went for the first time in March 2020 (yes, ONE week before the shutdown hit) with my mom.

I did the staten island ferry for the statue and enjoyed sometime on staten island before coming back. I did Brooklyn Bridge and walked both ways and enjoyed DUMBO and Brooklyn. I honestly loved it and felt very safe being alone in NY during the day. It was always busy but it meant a lot was going on. Very hot at summer though. I went to the vanderbilt for the skyline and did a cheesy solo walking tour of the big sites. I did go to see the ghost busters fire station but that&#39;s because ghost busters was a favourite childhood movie. I love your channel and I loved NY",6,0,James Birtwistle

4078,mWzogob2cq0,"I go into the city all the time and for some reason, I had no desire to go into Central Park.  That is until one day in 2019.  I heard about Belvedere Castle and it had reopened after being under refurbishment.  My trip that day was going to the City of New York Museum (which is right on Museum Mile across from the park) and then hitting up the castle.  That was my first time ever in the park.  As I was walking to the castle, I found some other interesting things along the way (like Cleopatra‚Äôs Needle).  After my trip there, I booked a tour of Central Park from free tours by foot.  We went through Central Park South and the mid section, but not Central Park North; so I went on my own a month later to explore and discovered two waterfalls in Central Park North.  Who would have thought Manhattan had waterfalls?  Central Park is so massive that it‚Äôs impossible to explore all of it in one day IMO.

On some days we did 15 miles walking‚Ä¶and we are both in/around our 60s and the arthritis in my knees killed me but I would not change it.<br><br>The cost, its Expensive, offensively so, here in Spain a beer at a local bar 2,60$.. NY 7$ for a house beer during happy hour, get the wrong beer at wrong hour.. 14$..<br><br>I don‚Äôt smoke, if i did, in Spain 5$ a packet, Manhattan back street store 18$<br><br>Meal sizes are 30% larger than we have here, we side stepped this by just eating once a day.<br><br>Must visit? Stattin island Ferry, its free, great views of the statue of Liberty.<br><br>Ground Zero. Seeing the memorial pools was enough, i had enough flashbacks that the museum tour would have crushed me, i saw the events on tv live on the day, shed enough tears and still carry the scars.<br><br>‚ÄòKeens Steakhouse‚Äô.. excellent meal, book in advance, ask for Lincoln room, hell they were able to give me blue cheese and crackers with a glass of Port as dessert (i am old school) but finally tally was 400$+ for two for dinner.<br><br>Shopping in Times Square is nuts, no matter what size you are you will find it but again not cheap, 15$ a T shirt no brand here, 180$ in Times Square for T shirts.<br><br>Plain Hot Dog 3$<br><br>Ride on a horseback carriage? 65$ for 20 minutes. Yellow cab? Quick convenient and expensive, 5,5 mile / 7,5km was 36$.<br><br>Points of note. The steam coming up from the streets is famous, makes for some good photos, the smells, the street vendors give the city an amazing bbq/curry smell that just makes you hungry by walking..<br><br>Best time to shop? 9am to 12.. after 12 its just to busy.<br><br>Biggest disappointment? All the ‚Äòmust eat / must visit‚Äô places are over crowded, went to tacos number 1, faced a 1 hour wait with no seating (chelsea market) and Katz was the same with no hope in hell of a seat.. my advice, go at 4am.. with my arthritis no way i could stand that long.",1,3,DJAnarkros DJ & Youtuber

You can get very nice views of Manhattan by taking the ferry north from Pier 6 in Brooklyn Bridge Park.

4888,I9gotv1kmzM,Do tourists really complain about having to walk in nyc? That is actually maddening. The crown jewel of NYC is its walk-ability.,131,11,ShadowCrashed81
4889,I9gotv1kmzM,That tip on shoes is spot on. I visited Manhattan in 2018 and my old worn down very loosely fitting sneakers with me. Had at least 6 blisters on each foot by the end of the day. Also if you&#39;re not simply used to walking a lot i recommend you literally start taking walks daily 5-6 weeks before your trip. Living extremely sedentary lifestyle and then all of sudden you walk and stay on your feet the whole day will wreck your feet no matter how good of a shoe pair you got.,17,0,Betoni
4890,I9gotv1kmzM,The Staten Island Ferry is another nice 25 minute cruise between Staten Island and Manhattan (at the base of Battery Park). It runs every 20 minutes during rush hour (6am-9am) and (4pm-8pm). It&#39;s every half hour other times. Best of all? You can get great pics of the Statue of Liberty and is free. It runs 24 hours.,46,1,Damsel In A Dress

4892,I9gotv1kmzM,"The ‚Äúpointing at the indication board‚Äù is adapted from Japan rail companies. <br><br>They‚Äôre trained to point at indicator signed and vocalize what the sign means. This greatly reduces operational mistakes. In the case of the NYC system it indicates to the conductor that the train is positioned properly on the platform to then open the doors safely as some platforms actually have signals mid-platform which the driver must obey resulting is the train not fully in the station. On the NYC subway, it‚Äôs the conductor, not the driver who controls the doors unlike most other cities with  staffed trains.",34,0,lohphat
4893,I9gotv1kmzM,"That&#39;s awesome you mentioned the Long Island Railroad. I boarded the railroad instead of the subway accidentally and ended up saving myself 45 mins. I didn&#39;t have a ticket when they checked for tickets (I had a Metro Card), but was able to buy a ticket on board to Grand Central for $5.",1,0,Jason Barney
4894,I9gotv1kmzM,"As a resident of Eastern Queens, I have an added tip for the LIRR from Jamaica to Penn Station from JFK. There is a ticket option called CityTicket that you can ride any off-peak train for $5.00 one way anywhere within Zones 1 and 3(Manhattan Brooklyn and Queens Stations.) It is valid all week on off-peak trains only. I use it all the time going between my home and Manhattan.",13,3,Joseph Wind
4895,I9gotv1kmzM,I love Bleecker Street Pizza.  Thanks for mentioning it.  I think it doesn‚Äôt get the attention it deserves because some other guy gave them a biased review.

5121,JtfZPgWxlMI,"Great video, thank you. I&#39;m a fan of your helpful points of view and glad you&#39;ve made it to my home city. I have a correction: no right on red, ever. In all 5 boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island) drivers are not allowed to turn right during a red light. (That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s strictly enforced.) And if you&#39;re walking all bets are off. <br><br>Fellow fans and NYC travelers: Johnny T&#39;s NYC Tourist Tips is also a helpful video. The advice in it is spot on from us who live here. Kindly keep out of the way of the steady flow of foot traffic, especially during rush hour.<br><br>My recommendations:<br>Central Park is a must. The corner of East 59th Street &amp; 5th Avenue is one of the best crossroads in the world. It&#39;s the horse-and-carriage corner of the park, across the street is the Plaza hotel, catty corner is the Apple Store (the one that is a glass cube). To the north on 5th Avenue, you have Museum Mile with The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Guggenheim, and many others. To the south on 5th Avenue, you have Tiffany&#39;s, St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, and Rockefeller Center. <br><br>Do not rent a car here. First of all, you&#39;re going to get killed in rental and parking charges (plus tax). Secondly, the average is 6.5 mph (10.4 km/h) driving in Manhattan. Use your smart phone to get subway directions, or just walk. <br><br>Enjoy and Thank you",10,1,Brooklyn Hellbetty

5123,JtfZPgWxlMI,"If you&#39;re doing the tourist thing, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a must see plus you get the additional bonus of a three-day pass to all the museums that are run by the Met such as the Cloisters, which is a particular favorite of mine. Essentially this means one full day at the Met with two more to see the other stuff. Be aware that the price is by suggested donation for New Yorkers and $25 for everyone else, but that&#39;s still a great deal since 1) the Met is one of the greatest museums of art in the world (plus you don&#39;t have to wait an hour or more to get in for same-day tickets), and 2) you get the other museums in the system as add-on.

5140,JtfZPgWxlMI,"My wife and I are going to NYC in August (our first trip, although I went there so far back (without proper resources) it doesn&#39;t really count) and then in September we&#39;re going back to Mexico City for a second time, after enjoying a week there over the holidays 2017/2018.  I expect both cities to have pluses and minuses.  We&#39;re from the Los Angeles area, so we have that as a lifelong benchmark, both good and bad.  I will be particularly interested in two things, since culture and food are wonderful in both places (and, yes, Californians largely do NOT know what good pizza tastes like):  1.  Convenience of public transportation and 2. Cost-per-benefit ratio.  My own personal experience with public trans (largely the metro/subway system) for Los Angeles is F, for Chicago it&#39;s a B, and for CDMX, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile it&#39;s an A.  Plus, in Mexico City, you can go ANYWHERE for five or six pesos!  That&#39;s 25 to 30 cents, USD.  Simple, affordable, and it gets around a city which probably is slightly bigger than NYC.  The other thing is food.  Quality of food is probably equal (as a Californian, I am absolutely DYING to try authentic NY pizza (having a taste for it in Connecticut/Mass./Upstate NY).  But so far, my favorite food in all the world is CDMX genuine street/sidewalk food.  There is no froo-froo involved:  fresh ingredients, purchased at a nearby market, no preservatives, no tricks, no hidden ingredients, all prepared while you watch (and not too long!), friendly neighbors offering a chair or a tip, and a genuine, almost family atmosphere, for ALWAYS less than $5, usually even less.  It&#39;s hard to beat, and it&#39;s addictive.  Who knew you could do so much with fresh produce and a little fresh chicken, pork or beef?  Still, I am excited by our late-summer visit to NYC and exploring just a few of its highlights (we will have tix to a game at Yankee Stadium), but especially the off-the-beaten track places, like we did in CDMX and Buenos Aires.  We find that back streets are the places where you really discover the culture and the people.  Geez.  I&#39;m long-winded about this.  Sorry.",4,0,Denys A

5242,JtfZPgWxlMI,Tip for NYC: Although it may seem like the city was made for tourist 8 million people live there. They have work and they have lives so when you&#39;re here don&#39;t clog up the sidewalks or walk slow or walk 3 people wide. People in the city will help you if you ask but please help them by not making their already hectic commute harder. NYC is fast paced and can be overwhelming if you&#39;ve never been before so just keep moving and you&#39;ll be a-okay.,0,1,Thewoldster

It is silly for them to rely on consumers to pay for their living expenses) but I do not take that out on them by revengefully not tipping when the service is good, if it&#39;s bad then don&#39;t.

5533,JtfZPgWxlMI,"Hey where is the episode of the Greater New York City area?! <br>Tip:  Avoid Times Sq like the plague! Grab a few pics if you can get through the crowds then leave, there&#39;s absolutely nothing there except over-priced chain food restaurants. Although the subway system, the MTA is 24 hours, it gets painfully slow after midnight with many interrupted stops, so if you&#39;re a party goer, cab will have to be it. I recommend using a ride sharing service like VIA, it&#39;s the most economical I&#39;ve found at any given time within Manhattan. If you&#39;re coming from a cleaner and civilized country, jk, but seriously don&#39;t be surprised at how dirty NYC is, the effort to promote recycling is just not really encouraged here and it&#39;s a shame. That being said NYC has SO much to offer and that&#39;s just the city, if you venture out to Long Island like Montauk after the summer season is simply serene. I live in Queens, born and raised here and it&#39;s one of the must culturally diverse places ever! I&#39;ve traveled all around Europe, South America, Asia and nothing beats the food in NYC. I can&#39;t find midnight ramen or roti massaman delivered to my door anywhere else. I live in Flushing, Queens and the food has always been the highlight of living here.

It seemed like it had had it&#39;s hay day in the 1960&#39;s and then nothing invested, or maintained ever since. The famous Hotel I stayed in on Time Square was 4 star ( but not) it was only 2  Star anywhere else. I wrote a whole 2 pages of all things that were wrong with it ( big things a lot of them ) and then screwed it up and threw it in the bin. Macy&#39;s a big but ordinary store with a lot of tat. Central Park, only lightly maintained, Turtle Pond full of algae and smelly  nothing too pretty or nice there. One Times Square Building - ?  Well it&#39;s hardly Shanghai or Tokyo nothing special in terms of lights.  Potholes everywhere, bins overflowing, nasty Arab food trolleys on every corner. Fairly dear to stay in New York for what you get.  Staten Island - walked off the ferry and then took a couple of roads by foot, It was so rough and hostile, druggies, closed down shops and all else - turned straight around and caught the ferry back. Every point of service has some  passive/aggressive  demanding  a 15 -20% tip. Not like that everywhere else in the civilized world - thankfully.  And what is good about New York ?   Saks is very good. and NY  it&#39;s quirky and interesting in places.",0,0,20Alanpartridge

5639,JtfZPgWxlMI,"Ok everyone my man did a good job but he might not have some of the native knowledge you need to know. First and foremost, his pizza recommendations are totally wrong and tourists traps. Johns on bleeker, joes on 7th. Avoid dollar slices they‚Äôre great on a budget but you‚Äôre visiting, get the good stuff. In Brooklyn Difaras is best all NYC but its deep in Brooklyn, otherwise Lucalis is amazing in iconic neighborhood of carrol gardens Brooklyn. Brooklyn. You must spend at least 2 days in Brooklyn alone there‚Äôs just as much to do as in the city (Manhattan). You‚Äôre gonna want to see iconic Coney Island and get your Nathans hot dog, if you‚Äôre visiting during the summer you simply can‚Äôt pass on Coney Island. South Brooklyn (near Brooklyn bridge) is amazing and has some of the best restaurants in NY. If in season go to the Bronx for a Yankees game then arthur avenue after for dinner thats the real little Italy. <br>Here‚Äôs the real pro tips:<br>1. Walk fast on busy streets or you‚Äôll see why we have a reputation (thats not true at all) for being rude, if you‚Äôre walking slow your actually the one being rude. <br>2. This ONLY applies in busy areas during the rush. Don‚Äôt make eye contact or smile at strangers, especially on the subway. Again this is rude.<br>3. If in a busy deli/store/pizzeria no small talk, the words please and thank you are meaningless. Give your order, get out the way, have your payment ready. Holding up the flow is again rude, and the cashier probably deals with thousands of people a day, they just cant give everyone attention.<br>4. Avoid staten island, its a dump (no really it is) and the people there are terrible.<br><br>Basically go by the old saying ‚Äúwhen in rome, do as the romans do‚Äù NYC is Rome.<br>Don‚Äôt be nervous, believe me we‚Äôre some of the friendliest people in the world despite what you heard. You need directions ask somebody (just not someone walking fast with their head down) you‚Äôll get them, detailed with patience, and probably followed by a recommendation. Our night life is unmatched, make friends but don‚Äôt trust anyone if thats makes sense. Until you actually get to know them. It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre untrustworthy it‚Äôs just that there are a lot of scams.<br>Remember its a city of 8.5 million people and has as many as 15 even 20 million on a given day with commuters and tourists. Some are gonna be jerkoffs, but most are cool. We‚Äôre a city made up of every walk of life, and we pretty much all get along. We wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

Ask anyone who has been a waiter, especially as a busy restaurant and they&#39;ll give you the exact opposite respone. you feel so robbed of your hard work when customers don&#39;t tip. Not every business works as simply as you think. Every restaurant is different and the cost of food sometimes barely covers the expense of making it and then paying all the kitchen staff and enough for the owners to make a profit, otherwise why open a restaurant. The servers on the other hand are the most expendable parts of a restaurant business and get paid something like $2 an hour. And some restaurants, waiters dont get a wage so if you tip nothing, they literally go home to their families with nothing. so imagine you working for 10 hours and everybody tipped nothing. you would make $20 for a whole day&#39;s work, enough to pay for your gas going to and from work sometimes..

As a someone who grew up in the surrounding NYC area going to shows all the time, (just graduated with a BFA in theatre recently as well) the nighttime shows are gonna be much higher energy from not only the crowd, but the performers. As a stage actor myself having to do a two show day is tough, and the matinee can be hard to get your energy up for.

Much cheaper rates and low crime levels. Booked early just before Covid restrictions were lifted. Saved a fortune.<br><br>Other smart moves, gave myself the last several months to work out a daily itinerary (if I don&#39;t stick to it exactly, that&#39;s fine, it&#39;s just a guide) worked out smart where to go and how to maximise time seeing and doing. So I am not back and forth all day missing out. Things I do are in a line basically. One after the other, smart and efficient.  Little things like the best affordable breakfast places and so forth. Sure, I&#39;ll also just try pot luck but I&#39;m doing my best to take the risk and disappointment out of the trip. <br><br>Used my time now to plan and find the deals and things I want to see and do, how to do it rather than wasting time when there. Every second is precious so I won&#39;t be wasting time unless it&#39;s enjoying the moment or just going off track to experience the city. Which is not wasting time at all! Scratching my head in my phone trying to work out where I am and what to do, that&#39;s wasting time. Not to mention making me a target. <br><br>I paid up front for a town car to pick me up at the airport and get me fast to the hotel. Again booked in advance so very reasonably priced. So I actually get a useful half day out of my travel day to NYC in the city. <br><br>Yes the subway or bus would have been cheaper but with a roller bag, shoulder bag and backpack, that&#39;s a hassle.",0,0,thegeneral123

We visited New York about 4 years ago.Just near Time Sauare . ‚Ä¶ we could see hundreds of garbage bags full of rubbish all lined up to be collected from the side of the roads. You present a very civilised and high standard New York. And please don‚Äôt tell me that we were on the low class area of N Y. . There were no bins in sight as in Australia.Sorry to disappoint some . All the stars on the walk way were so filthy. As a  mark of respect to the stars who have contributed to the Art world. I would expect some respect. Not to the stars only but to the world who visit that the stars be kept clean . Quite low bottom of the scale but watching this video really lift my spirit. Thank you again.

Never ever need to plan out ourselves the changes, as if another past ever gets there to feed any semblance of a monopoly.  Buildings may someday scrape and the earth may churn, but in that new Gotham of a hundred million or so people, souls... will re-incarnate, not cities the other way.  Otherwise the blind hell of death would suck the gentle people into its pipes and crevasses and chasms, horrifically as unable to breathe or just be.  Our presences as souls could re-achieve the neutral plane of existence that way.  To be included with that as higher is ok as good that way, and maybe someday as we get better as all loving kindness, we will be able to breathe as souls that well, too.  In the immaterial sense, it already was that way;  but for what I&#39;d have called &quot;my&quot; people, ones I didn&#39;t know any better except as the calm form of life then having also still had its way life sprang forth for eternity, that way as cell systems related to other life existing presence in matter.",2,0,Misther Funkiller and the Funkstar Prodigee

These counties have steadily lost population for the last 50 years and home prices are also losing ground and sitting vacant.  I had a long conversation with a local real estate executive and he explained that the state has abandoned these outlying counties forcing them to raise their taxes to unprecedented levels to survive.

We rode the subway without issue, we ate a lot of great food and didn&#39;t get stuck in tourist traps. We had the best time and credit you for much of it.

The stations marked with a white dot (where the express trains stop) usually have such paths.  You also just ask a local person which stops will let you turn around.",28,1,Carl Mueller
7684,YfT5vhrYXBI,Before I abandoned my plans for New York I had broken down the destinations by area like you suggested but I also sorted them by weather. Since it can rain I had places to see indoors when it rains like museums. So there was a rainy downtown and sunny downtown list. Same for midtown and uptown. Plus it had must dos and then extras. So I could have six lists but each day would change plans according to weather.,49,0,David Lazarus

Then I transitioned to a carry-on suitcase.   Now for a 3-day (my typical stay), I bring a good size backpack and a tote  bag.  The back pack is NOT a huge outdoor kitting backpack , but it&#39;s larger than the normal size.  I got it at Target.  Basically just a extra pair of lightweight Sketcher shoes (my storage space splurge), undies, minimal toiletries, small PJs.      The backpack is not heavy and saves me from pulling a wheeled bag from Penn Station to the hotel.      #2.  Learn the routes of where you&#39;re going on the subway before you get there.   I think I&#39;ve gotten the letter and directions pretty well by now, but I am still struck with fear when I see &quot;Express&quot; because I don&#39;t know if they will go past my stops if I&#39;m a little further out.   LOL. Otherwise though, it makes for a much better experience.    #3.  Definitely make a plan, if not excessively detailed.

7775,YfT5vhrYXBI,"I have driven into Manhattan and through Manhattan to Brooklyn. Street parking can be &quot;free&quot; but you need to keep an eye on the signs. Really check the signs.  When there is street cleaning you need to ensure you move your car.  Far as what I normally do when I visit.  I park in New Jersey at Metropark and pay less than 10 dollars a day to park an midsized SUV. This is a train station, so you walk out of the parking garage that is in a Business Park and the train is right there. Then take the train right to Penn Station. Then I can hop a 1 up to my hotel. If you must park in the city, look at your hotel. Sometimes there are deals with a parking garage close to the hotel. It&#39;s cheap and reserved (in some cases).   I used to park on Station Island. It was 7 dollars a day, I would prepay for the time I would be there. Nobody bothered the car as it was a manned lot.  This was before the outlet mall.. I am not sure if you can park for days at a time at the outlet and the cost.  I would much rather park on Staten Island and take the Ferry.  It&#39;s a nice introduction to the city.

9319,oM1CSIUwjHU,"Here&#39;s another tip: When strolling on the sidewalk, if you want to pause to take a photo, step close to the curb (but obviously not into traffic) or back against the side of a building to take your photo.<br>NEVER stop right in the middle of the sidewalk because you will impede the flow of pedestrian traffic and are likely to get shouldered or bumped into by a fast-moving pedestrian.",281,14,Hypestrike1
9320,oM1CSIUwjHU,"Here are a couple more (you may have covered some in other videos - so watch the NYC Tips Playlist). 1a Not factoring in the location of where you&#39;re staying in relation to where the majority of places you plan to visit are located. 1b Planning to &quot;Uber it everywhere&quot; or not planning your transportation in advance - traffic and surge pricing will eat into your time and cost savings. 2. Dressing for fashion over function - unless you&#39;re going to a gala at the Met or a restaurant that requires a dinner jacket, keep it basic and functional. 3. Not bringing a reusable poncho and a quality drawstring backpack. The drawstring backpack is easy to pack, not as bulky, and good for carrying your water bottle, poncho, etc. <br><br>Tip: If you do have a car (perhaps you&#39;re on a road trip and NYC is one of your stops) park at a train station in the suburbs and take the train into the city. It will be cheaper by the time you factor in tolls, parking, and possible tickets. Plus the time it will take you to drive in and out of the city is about the same time or more compared to taking the train from the suburbs.",146,9,J F
9321,oM1CSIUwjHU,Another major mistake that should be added is visiting the same chain eateries in NYC that one can find in one&#39;s own home town.,573,32,Joe Dazey
9322,oM1CSIUwjHU,"Actually avoided a lot of these by watching a ton of your videos and piecing the tips together.  Great compilation video.  If I can add a tip, consider a bicycle tour of Central Park.  Rent an e-bike if you worry about hills or pedaling for a couple hours.  We saw most of the major attractions and can now target specific areas to focus on in future visits.",70,0,Randy Hoffman
9323,oM1CSIUwjHU,"I definitely concur with the &quot;knowing what you plan to order before getting online&quot; tip. Once when I was a teen, we came into the city and stopped off at a diner for lunch. When I started hemming and hawing about what to order, the server straight up told me &quot;I ain&#39;t got time for you, boy!&quot;&quot; Kind of sums it up.",75,0,S Persnickety
9324,oM1CSIUwjHU,"I lived in NYC for years and tip#4 is gold. New yorkers really aren&#39;t rude, but if you stop and look for directions in a busy part of a station or in the middle of the sidewalk you&#39;ll get some crap. As a tourist please be aware that 9 million people actually live here and they&#39;re trying to get to work/pick up kids/buy groceries/get home.<br><br>My two big tips: 1) spend time in the outer boroughs. They&#39;re less busy but there&#39;s lots of great things to see like Coney Island, Arthur Avenue, Brooklyn museum, etc. 2) schedule a Big Apple Greeter. Did you know you can get a <b>free</b> tour guide to take you around for 4 hours? They even match you with someone with similar interests as you.",35,3,douglasjgallup

9326,oM1CSIUwjHU,"One of the biggest mistakes I made as a tourist in NYC was telling the taxi driver I wasn‚Äôt from NYC and was in fact a tourist. At first, he came off as very friendly and polite, but that quickly changed once the ride was over. I didn‚Äôt have cash on me, so when I went to pay with my card, I clicked the card paying option and all of the sudden he was demanding I pay in cash and that I had apparently clicked the cash paying option, which I certainly did not. My sister was there as a witness. After arguing with me for a few minutes, he forced me take out money from an ATM at a nearby convenience store after threatening to call the police. Moral of the story is: always carry cash on you when riding a taxi and don‚Äôt let them know you‚Äôre a tourist. I ended up taking Lyfts and Ubers the rest of the trip when I wasn‚Äôt walking. üòÖ",2,0,Gabby M

9330,oM1CSIUwjHU,"I only visited NYC once for a week about 8 years ago. We spent a whole day and evening exploring Central Park. Walked and zig zagged back and forth for the entire length. We would take the subway sometimes to a destination and walk for miles back. Mostly we got familiar with a  Iot of the city. My suggestion is forget observation decks unless the wait is short. It was hours when we were there. Maybe I am a savvy traveler because I try to avoid tourist areas. I like to call myself a traveler, not a tourist.",7,0,akahina
9331,oM1CSIUwjHU,"As a Londoner who visited New York (just Yesterday as of from this post) I do have to say the city is AMAZING üòç I am glad to say that I only did 2 of the things that you said to avoid to 1 of which is Central Park we spent 2 hrs in Central Park but we did want to do other things 2 was misreading the Subway but I must say that is probably the only gripe I&#39;ve got with NY. The public transport either partial informal or just isn&#39;t informal non whatsoever (tho I never did use the bus so I cannot speak for that) but go to any London Underground &amp; you will know not just your line (or be reassured that this line will call at your stop) but also if there are any lines ideal for you to transfer in order to reach your destination. Not only that but I wish that for the sake tourist&#39;s there was any way to say if this is a stop that is nearby a landmark for example if you were at London Underground &amp; you wanted to get off at Hyde Park or Buckingham Palace the train via an  automated PA or on map will say &quot;this is Green Park alight here for Hyde Park or Buckingham Palace &quot; other than that the Subway was ok to use but one I can&#39;t stand is NTransit (NJ Transit?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) but you really need to be more forthcoming with the info on your trains dude we only used it twice (from &amp; to the airport) but using your train system was hella confusing. But hey I do plan to go again New York is one hell of a city &amp; the fact that the city is  mapped like a grid it&#39;s really easy to find your way around, put bluntly 7th ave = Times Square 6th ave = financial district &amp; 5th ave = is shops galore! <br><br>Anyways I&#39;ll keep this video in for when I next go.<br>CHEERS!!!!!! üòÅ",12,0,Spoonie 82
9332,oM1CSIUwjHU,My family and I just did our first NYC trip.  I think these are great suggestions however I do have to disagree with one of them‚Ä¶ instead of picking one observatory I think you should pick two.  One to see the city during the day and the other at night.  We did The Edge at Hudson yards as our day observatory and Top of the Rock for the night one.  You really need to see the City from both day and night perspectives.,16,0,Bill Montgomery
9333,oM1CSIUwjHU,"Thank you for pointing out that New Yorkers are almost always willing to help out visitors. We&#39;re usually in a hurry (I mean, just look at the place!) but if your question is specific you&#39;ll get a quality answer most of the time.

9334,oM1CSIUwjHU,I was in NYC last September and avoided the Observation decks because I did not want to get into long lines. I almost did get the train in the wrong direction once and this seems to be more common on the tiny stations with old confusing signage.,12,1,Eric Toribio

9336,oM1CSIUwjHU,"That weather report tip, to me, is mostly common sense but even so, you should do it everywhere, including your hometown, not just NYC.

9337,oM1CSIUwjHU,"Rule 4 just reminded me of my most frequent frustration. I already hated it whenever people stopped in the middle of the street even before I came to new york.

9511,oM1CSIUwjHU,"Oh and one other tip. It is still a functioning city with lots of people trying to get to where they need to go. Lots of people are in a hurry so if you do, think, act, or behave in any way that is going to inconvenience or delay anyone else you&#39;ll stick out like a sore thumb, and you&#39;ll be a jerk. Everyone gets lost, even NYers, so if you do get out of the way. Everyone needs to double check their phone or directions or their food order or whatever, just get out of the way when you do. Everyone sometimes makes mistakes on the train. Laugh it off and switch to the right one or the right direction and keep going. Also, don&#39;t be afraid to ask MTA people about the subway. It can be pretty confusing esp if you&#39;re dead tired from jet lag like I was and couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out my butt from a hole in the ground, but eventually you&#39;ll make it fine. It&#39;s not Tokyo&#39;s subway in terms of comfort, efficiency, and figuring out where to go, but it helps.<br><br>Getting a taxi can also be annoying, and there are a few unspoken rules about it, so yes I know the taxi drivers need the money but to be honest Lyft or Uber was the best option for some of the things I had to do. Just be clear of where you are on the street and who to look out for, and don&#39;t wait on the side of a bus lane where they can&#39;t park if you can help it.<br><br>Make reservations as much as you can for your food. You&#39;ll be glad you did because the better places fill up quickly. You&#39;ll be doing a lot of walking and will not want to wait for your food. <br><br>As far as pizza goes, yes everyone goes to Joes, but branch out if you can. Everyone has a little different taste, and like Tokyo where you can survive off of 24 hour ramen, if you find a great pizza place that sells by the slice in NYC close to your stay that&#39;s open late, you&#39;re set. If you want Joe&#39;s? Be prepared to wait 30 min for a few slices at least. OR you can have it delivered. A whole pie with tip delivered can run you $40 but its large enough that you&#39;ll have it in your fridge for days.<br><br>I also think the WTC is the best observation tower in the city. Better than Vanderbilt and the Empire state building. Empire is way too crowded (but if you want to see it once, go ahead).

My boyfriend owned several outboard motor boats at different times, and we spent time out on the south shore almost every day in the spring, summer and fall. Short Beach and Zach&#39;s Bay were favorites places of ours, and we even dropped anchor and slept out there too. Port Jefferson Harbor on the north side was a nice place to visit, and although I never did it, there&#39;s a ferry that goes to Connecticut. Good times.",0,0,Gem Ini

Some of the stuff that you saw is what the New Yorkers are seeing, and not very happy. This is the reason city elected the new Mayor who ran on a law and order platform amongst many. Many locals are complaining about seeing a lot more of it on the streets. NYC was much cleaner and safer during Bloomberg years. Having said that NYC is still very safe.

Even though you also went through the various cultures, you didn&#39;t talk about the history of the black slave trade in New York either.  Since you had such comprehensive information about New York, I was surprised that you didn&#39;t include such important elements under &#39;history&#39; or how the black slave trade was integral in the the building of New York.   You also mentioned your dislike of the museum of the history of New York, showing &#39;Black Lives Matter&#39; and saying that there was not a balanced view.  Maybe an oversight here, but it certainly looked ignorant.",1,0,Hineraumoa

12149,dxsawQOQ9lU,The garbage collection situation in Manhattan is the grossest and dumbest thing I&#39;ve experienced in my travels across the US.  I just can&#39;t understand how citizens tolerate it.  The smell in summer is indescribable.  The fact that 20 billionaires haven&#39;t shook hands on who would take credit for funding/fixing the problem and when... It basically sums up the &quot;filthy rich&quot; foundation of Manhattan.  I get the city&#39;s design doesn&#39;t lend itself to typical collection methods but figure that shit out Manhattan... you are the capital of the world... and you smell like a million portable toilets at a garbage dump.  It seriously took 2 days for me to give up and leave.  Our trip was planned for 5 days and we left on the 3rd.  I hated seeing the worlds largest ball of twine but that&#39;s where you sent me New York.

This is a much safer, cleaner and faster trip than the subway. (And often times, faster than a taxi).

12869,l6V0Ze0A7OQ,Our horns were a form of communication. People here in the south don‚Äôt know what a horn is. Definitely don‚Äôt recommend driving in Ny. I agree on the walking but the subway is so interesting. It can be scary as well. I used to take the train into the city on weekends to walk around and go to museums. Walking is definitely worth it in NYC. Also get a subway card. We have raising canes here in charleston. Jamaica station is kind of considered a bad area but there is usually security around but it is hit or miss. My family tends to not want to drive out to JFK so when we visit we tend to do airtrain to Jamaica and get LI railroad. It can be sketchy!,0,0,Doods and Dudes

Luckily her father and I are in careers that have made us very observant and he was not able to take her, but that could have gone really badly for someone else.

You&#39;re not participating in tourism when you give those folks money.  Those folks were just whiny losers and hustlers, not artists or established tourism businesses.  Literally everyone in this video was a nobody who asked for money for pictures or nothing.  The Naked Cowboy seems to be the only exception.  It appeared he doesn&#39;t actually solicit money but rather displays and makes money from his other products.  I noticed he didn&#39;t solicit anything in this interview.  Ever meet a REAL celebrity and taken a photo?  Do they ever ask for money?  Wouldn&#39;t you rather go to NYC and get in a photo with a movie star for free rather than some lying loser hustler who asks for 5, 10, 20 dollars?<br><br>Also never accept anything for free unless it&#39;s in the name of public service like a face mask during COVID.  For instance, those CD guys in Time Square will tell you to take it without charge like it&#39;s a free sample then turn around on you demanding money, not accept the CD back, pull the race card, act like a victim and accuse you of not paying.

Standing on a long, long line in the freezing cold waiting to go into Radio City Music Hall when I was a kid, looking at all the magnificent store windows at Christmas time esp. the famous magical Lord &amp; Taylor ones which we took our three daughters to see as well, the Tree at Rockefeller Center and when I was really little eating hot chestnuts from a brown paper bag on the steps of the gorgeous NY Public Library at night with those wreaths around the necks of those stone Lions at the front of the library! When I lived in Manhattan, shopping at all the stores at Xmas and having to walks blocks against the freezing wind to my apartment on the Upper East Side! The wind would come blasting down those streets from the East River! The Christmas decorations everywhere! Going to see the Nutcracker Suite at Lincoln Center and then the snow coming down when we got out! There was also a wonderful little German candy store on East 86th Street that sold novelty chocolates and gingerbread houses because Yorkville used to be heavily populated with people of German descent like myself on my paternal side. When you live in NYC or visit there, you soak up as many wonderful memories as you can! Had a couple of negative experiences like being robbed once which was terrifying, but other than that, it&#39;s mostly positive ones, thankfully! A fun exciting city and remember sensing the electricity in the air once when I was staying at a friend&#39;s apt which looked right out on the top of the Empire State Building all lit up at night! AMAZING! &quot;New York, New York, it&#39;s a wonderful town, the Bronx is up and the Battery&#39;s down&quot; like the song goes from the 1940s along with some other wonderful songs that the late great Frank Sinatra sang about New York City!

15359,kaoILYFb8cE,"Jon, wonderful job with the video - many people miss out on the northern end of the park, which is amazing in its own way (as you explored). I wouldn&#39;t miss wandering in the North Woods (get that real forest feel in the big city), stopping by the Lasker Rink/Pool (depending on the time of year), the Mount (yes, CP/NYC&#39;s HUGE compost pile! I couldn&#39;t believe it), walking/running around the reservoir (which has its own incredible history), and of course, visiting the Balto statue near E 67th. Again, great work!",17,0,BNiche

It‚Äôs not the biggest or the fanciest zoo in the city, but I enjoy it. üòÅ",4,0,Christopher Lee
15365,kaoILYFb8cE,"We just came back from NYC - about a week ago. I love your videos along with Brett&#39;s and Sarah&#39;s. I watch them all the time and I thought I knew what I was doing, but the moment we landed in NYC, everything become very chaotic... Our younger son got sick and from there on, everything was just walking around the city. We went to Central Park starting from the Zoo and we could only get to the Lake. Everything is so distracting that we did not have much more time to see anything else. What I think will be a great idea and I will definitely do it next time - Print a map of the park with markings for all the attractions from this video, for example. Then you won&#39;t miss anything by just passing near it and not noticing. I have created a channel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfATbNCbCD-jKXjNBSgEkvg)"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfATbNCbCD-jKXjNBSgEkvg)</a> with all the videos we did in NYC, but I have not uploaded those from Central Park yet. There was a man singing &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; very very good, there was another one that was collecting foreign currency and got very excited when we told him we are from Bulgaria. Then our 3 yo kid decided to feed the ducks with pretzels LOL. So from conversation to conversation and we could not see even 1/4 of the Park. Having a visible map in front of your face while you walk can be great. The phone will not always work, because in the middle of the day you will be trying to preserve your battery for photos or just to be able to call an Uber to your hotel. Another cool thing about the paper map is that you can print the walking distance to each spot. We found this the hard way. I went for pizza one evening after I saw that the place is just around the corner only two blocks away on the same street. I ended up walking 2km to that place and with the order, it took me between 30 to 60 minutes to return with the Pizza",1,0,Ventsislav Georgiev

Great ideas in your video:  a few more: ¬†<br>-- The beautiful bridges -- especially the Bow Bridge for the most beautiful views in the park over the lakes often filled with several couples rowing and the grand apartments of Central Park West, including the Dakota peering over the treetops.<br>-- The Rambles which feels like a true forest that you can even get lost in, with hilly trails and beautiful views at every twist and turn.<br>-- Seeing concerts of the NY Philharmonic on the Great Lawn, with 10s of thousands of people on the lawn with picnic baskets and bottles of wine soaking in the most beautiful music as the twilight sky becomes darker and darker and where you can actually see the stars right in the beating heart of NYC.<br>-- Having lunch or dinner at the Boathouse Cafe or at Tavern on the Green, with their sublime settings, and quite good food.<br>-- Taking in the breathtaking views from &quot;The Pond&quot;, a smaller lake in the Southeast Corner of the park, framed by towering trees and the beautiful buildings of Central Park South gracefully rising above the tree tops and with the new soaring skyscrapers rising above those.  <br>-- Watching genuinely spectacular roller skaters just south of the overlook of Bethesda Fountain.<br>-- The broad walkway along the east side of Sheep Meadow, with towering old trees lining the walkway.<br>-  Without Central Park, NYC would .be a different city entirely.

They have three shows happening this summer, first is Much Ado About Nothing, next is Coriolanus, and finally is Disney&#39;s Hercules, which I am totally going to see.

15386,kaoILYFb8cE,"Barr in one of his videos gave one of the wisest pieces of advice which was not to do too much on your first day in New York. However, with the madness of wanting to see more and more, I didn&#39;t and on the first day, after riding the bus that took me to know the lower part of manhattan, I decided to go from times square walk all the uper west side to the cathedral of saint john divine to do the vertical tour , go up the tower and then go down the whole of central park. I really did that but and there is always but not everything went smoothly. First I got there at two and didn&#39;t even take the tour because I thought there might not be enough time to see all of central park and I&#39;d have to wait until 3. Then I went through central park to bevery castle. Well, I thought it was beautiful and walked and walked but always happy. Turns out I had a ticket bought online to see the met. I thought that&#39;s easy I&#39;m close but I got on the Rambles and ended up in the opposite place... I went straight to the Dakota building which was cool because I wanted to see it but being there I went down and went to the columbus circle hotel plaza and went up all the way again to to the MET museum. On the way I was already a zombie but a happy zombie. When I got there I still saw the Egyptian part and two more floors, until I practically couldn&#39;t walk normally. It looked like the skeetch of the mont pyhntons from the weird floor department. To go down the stairs I had to support myself. Upon leaving, I took a taxi and went to the hotel, which was not far away on 40 street, right next to the bus station. Conclusion, in theory I went all over central park but in practice I didn&#39;t see half of what they say in the video. That is, no matter how hard you try, it&#39;s huge and you can&#39;t see everything in the same day. The next day I was back to normal but I realized that New York was just like that and that when I felt that I was already exhausted it was better to stop and enjoy things calmly, besides I was traveling solo and despite being super safe it was convenient to be 100% . So I did that, I walked so much that I didn&#39;t even use the subway, I went from Times Square to Wall Street and a little further and from the Manhattan Bridge to Times Square, times square almost to harlem ... but when I saw that i was in a mess, I rested and sometimes i it was 4 o clock in the afertnoon  and i was resting in the hotel but its was necessary ! I loved this city , really amazing!",1,1,Filipe Freitas

The medicine was transferred from sled to sled but only balto‚Äôs team ran 3/4 of the way while the other sleds either crashed or got stuck in a monster blizzard. It made him an instant hero saving thousands of lives mostly children. The dog lived the rest of days in a zoo well cared for and his remains were stuffed and put in a museum while NYC honor the dog with the statue.

I rode with my bike in different places of¬† Manhattan and Brooklyn, Downtown, Midtown, Upper West and East sides of Manhattan, one of my favorite places are &quot;Gramercy Park area&quot;, Upper West side of Manhatten near to Central Park and few others places of Manhattan and Brooklyn and so on., and of course, there is only one New York in this world, but same time there are very difficult socio-economic and other problems, both in New York city and in the United States of America in general, which for decades have been recruited for ordinary residents, the majority of the population of New York and the whole of the United States of America. New York is such an extent impossible expensive this megapolis is, megapolis of very rich people, a corporations, financial¬† elite and the like., which means, together with all other things, problems, this city for a normal, good life is good only for the rich, for millionaires, and multimillionaires, even the most raunchy little apartment of some kind of dirty building, with cockroaches, with rats, and mice, is expensive for an ordinary person in New York, people survive, have very difficult social-economic, financial and so on problems, as well as in the United States of America in general, as a result of such a strong middle class, as the developed European countries have, the population of the United States of America does not practically have, therefore, serious socio-economic, financial, health-insurance, political and so on reforms are needed, including, respectively in New York too...New York is an incredibly, unbelievably expensive city for the average person, for the majority of the population, for life. Also, in many places of the city there is a lot of dirt, also in subway stations with rats and so on.,¬†...So, I mentioned about New York, good sides and bad sides and so on of this City, but New York is definitely a special city, Megacity, and whatever happens in the future, it will in any case remain a part of my life,¬†I also took and made photo/ pictures from different places of Manhattan, Brooklyn during these years...<br><br>Sincerely, Alex",5,3,Alex Khoshtaria

16471,FjU_x1106pg,"I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and lived here all of my life, 66 years.  I have been to NYC 2 times for several days each and LOVED every minute, even when they towed my car while staying at the Hyatt (52nd street?).  Turns out it was not Hyatt parking, my fault.  My brother was a block from the WTC on 9/11.  Someone pounding on the window was screaming to get out and run so he did. He ran to Battery park and hid behind a tree to avoid the giant dust cloud from the 1st building rushing across the bottom of the island.  Even after all of that, I still yearn to go back.  Your video shows so many familiar places and so much more that we missed. It is to much to see in less than a week (Maybe a month?).  Winter was HELL but still awesome. Spring and fall are picture perfect. Some friends told me once, &quot;You don&#39;t want to go there. The people are so rude.&quot;  Let me tell you, that is NOT true.  Having gone to Florida more than once, we thought they were sooo slow...  This is why many people don&#39;t like New York City. People do not understand that the fast of living in NYC does not allow you to think about what you want. Waiters will walk away.  Figure out what you want, then signal them and they will come back. If you are from a big city, like Chicago? The people will seem normal. I guess we seem like hicks to them.<br>Thank you for a well shot. beautiful video. It is addicting! I have a link on my desktop now!  I can&#39;t stop watching.  Cheers,  M Austin, Cincinnati, OH  USA",54,8,Mike AUSTIN

Por esto las v√≠rgenes te aman ‚Äì<br>[4] &quot;Ll√©vame contigo. Correremos tras de ti.&quot; El rey me ha llevado a sus aposentos.  (Coro) Estaremos alegres y nos gozaremos por ti. Alabaremos tu amor m√°s que el vino. ¬°Qu√© correcto es para ellos amarte!<br>[5] (Ella) Yo soy morena pero bella, ustedes hijas de Yerushalayim, como las tiendas de Kedar, como las cortinas de Shlom√≥.<br>[6] No fijes tu mirada en m√≠ porque soy morena; es el sol que me bronce√≥. Los hijos de mi madre estaban enojados conmigo  y me hicieron cuidar las vi√±as. Pero yo no he cuidado mis propias vi√±as.<br>[7] Dime, mi amor, ¬ød√≥nde pastoreas tu reba√±o, d√≥nde las haces descansar al mediod√≠a?; pues ¬øpor qu√© me pondr√© velo   junto a los reba√±os de tus amigos?<br>[8]   Si t√∫ no lo sabes, t√∫ la m√°s bonita de las mujeres, entonces sigue las huellas del reba√±o y deja que tus cabritos pasten junto a las tiendas de los pastores.<br>[9]   Mi amor, yo te comparo con mi yegua, halando uno de los carruajes de Fara√≥n ‚Äì<br>[10] tus mejillas son hermosas con ornamentos, tu cuello con su collar de cuentas,<br>[11] haremos tus ornamentos de oro, incrustados con plata.<br>[12]   Mientras el rey se reclina a la mesa, mi nardo exhalaba su perfume:<br>[13] para el hombre que amo es un ramillete de mirra que reposa entre mis pechos;<br>[14] para el hombre que amo es un roc√≠o de flores de alhe√±a en las vi√±as de Ein-Gedi.<br>[15]   ¬°M√≠rate, mi amor! ¬°Qu√© bella eres!

Amo sentarme a su sombra; su fruto es dulce a mi paladar.<br>[4] El me lleva a la sala de los banquetes; su bandera sobre m√≠ es amor. <br>[5] Sust√©ntame con pasas, refr√©scame con manzanas, porque estoy enferma con amor.<br>[6]   su brazo izquierdo   debajo de mi cabeza, y su brazo derecho alrededor de m√≠.<br>[7] ¬°Yo les advierto, hijas de Yerushalayim, por los alces y ciervos en los bosques, que no despierten ni agiten mi amor hasta que quiera mostrarse! <br>[8] ¬°La voz del hombre que amo! ¬°Aqu√≠ viene √©l, saltando sobre las monta√±as, brincando sobre las colinas!<br>[9] Mi amado es como un alce o un joven venado.

Tus ojos son palomas tras tu velo. Tu pelo es como reba√±o de cabras descendiendo corriendo del Monte Gilead.<br>[2] Tus dientes son como un reba√±o de ovejas trasquiladas que han salido de ser lavadas; cada una de ellas es apareada, y ninguna falta.<br>[3] Tus labios son como hilo escarlata, y tu boca es hermosa. Tus mejillas son como granadas cortadas a la mitad detr√°s de tu velo.<br>[4] Tu cuello es como la torre de David, edificada magn√≠ficamente, en la cual cuelgan mil broqueles, cada uno un escudo de un guerrero valiente.<br>[5] Tus dos pechos son como dos cervatos gemelos de la cierva paciendo entre los lirios.<br>[6] Cuando la brisa fresca del d√≠a empiece y las sombras se alarguen, yo ir√© a los montes de mirra a la colina del incienso. <br>[7] Todo en ti es bello, mi amada; eres sin defecto. <br>[8] Ven conmigo desde el Levanon, mi esposa, ven conmigo desde el Levanon. Desciende desde las alturas de Amanah, desde las alturas de Senir y Hermon, desde las guaridas de los leones y de las colinas donde rondan los leopardos. <br>[9] Mi hermana, mi esposa, ¬°te has robado mi coraz√≥n!  Con s√≥lo una mirada, con una cuenta de tu collar te has robado mi coraz√≥n.<br>[10] Mi hermana, mi esposa, ¬°qu√© dulce es tu amor! ¬°Cu√°nto mucho mejor tu amor que el vino, m√°s fragante tus perfumes que ninguna especia!<br>[11] Tus labios, mi esposa, destilan miel; miel y leche hay debajo de tu lengua; y la esencia de tus vestidos es como la esencia del Levanon.<br>[12] Mi hermana, mi esposa, es un jard√≠n cerrado, un estanque cubierto, una fuente sellada.<br>[13] Eres un huerto que tiene granadas y otros frutos preciados, alhe√±a y nardos ‚Äì<br>[14] nardo, azafr√°n y ca√±a arom√°tica, canela, y todo tipo de √°rbol de incienso, mirra, √°loes, y todas las mejores especias.<br>[15] T√∫ eres una fuente de jard√≠n, un manantial de agua corriente, fluyendo desde el Levanon.<br>[16]   ¬°Despierta, viento del norte! ¬°Ven, viento del sur! Sopla sobre mi jard√≠n para esparcir su fragancia. Deja que mi amada entre en su jard√≠n y coma sus mejores frutos.<br><br><br>Cantares:5<br> <br>[1]   Mi hermana, mi esposa, yo he entrado en mi jard√≠n; estoy recogiendo mi mirra y mis especias; estoy comiendo mi panal de miel junto con mi miel; estoy bebiendo mi vino como tambi√©n mi leche.   Coman, amigos, y beban, ¬°hasta que se emborrachen de amor!<br>[2]   Estoy dormida, pero mi coraz√≥n est√° despierto. ¬°Escuchen! ¬°Oigan a mi amado tocando!   ¬°Abre para m√≠, mi hermana, mi amada, mi paloma, m√≠a sin defecto! Porque mi cabeza est√° mojada con roc√≠o, mi pelo con la humedad de la noche.<br>[3]   Me he quitado el saco; ¬øtengo que pon√©rmelo de nuevo? He lavado mis pies; ¬ølos ensuciar√© otra vez?<br>[4] El hombre que amo meti√≥ su mano por el agujero de la cerradura, y mi coraz√≥n comenz√≥ a golpear de s√≥lo pensar en √©l.<br>[5] Me levant√© para abrir para el hombre que amo. Mis manos goteaban mirra ‚Äì mirra pura corr√≠a de mis dedos sobre la manilla del cerrojo.<br>[6] Abr√≠ para mi amado, pero mi amado se hab√≠a vuelto e ido. Mi coraz√≥n me hab√≠a fallado cuando √©l habl√≥ ‚Äì lo busqu√©, pero no lo pude encontrar; lo llam√©, pero √©l no respondi√≥.<br>[7] Los guardas rondando la ciudad me encontraron; me golpearon, me hirieron; se llevaron mi manto, ¬°aquellos guardas de los muros!<br>[8] Les encomiendo, hijas de Yerushalayim, que si encuentran al hombre que amo, ¬øqu√© le dir√°n? Que estoy enferma de amor. <br>[9]   ¬øC√≥mo se diferencia de otros el hombre que amas, t√∫ la m√°s bella de las mujeres? ¬øC√≥mo se diferencia de otros el hombre que amas, que dejas esta encomienda?<br>[10]   El hombre que yo amo es radiante y sonrosado; √©l se distingue entre diez mil.<br>[11] Su cabeza es como el oro m√°s fino; sus crespos son ondulados y negros como un cuervo.<br>[12] Sus ojos son como palomas junto a aguas que fluyen, ba√±ados en leche y puestos correctamente.<br>[13] Sus mejillas son como camas de especias, como bancos de hierbas fragantes. Sus labios son como lirios que destilan mirra dulce.<br>[14] Sus brazos son cetros de oro incrustados con berilio, su cuerpo, marfil pulido adornado con zafiros.<br>[15] Sus piernas son como columnas de m√°rmol asentadas en bases de oro fino.<br>[16] Sus mismas palabras son dulzura; todo √©l es deseable. Este es mi amor, y √©ste es mi amigo, hijas de Yerushalayim.",0,0,Humilde

16539,FjU_x1106pg,"1 Pedro:3<br> <br>[7] Ustedes esposos, igualmente conduzcan su vida de casados con entendimiento. A pesar de que su esposa pueda ser m√°s d√©bil f√≠sicamente; deben respetarla como una compa√±era heredera del don de la vida. Si no lo hacen, sus oraciones ser√°n estorbadas. <br>[8] Finalmente, todos ustedes sean de una sola mente y sentimientos, √°mense como hermanos, y sean misericordiosos y tengan en la mente la humildad,<br>[9] no devolviendo mal por mal ni insulto con insulto, pero por el contrario, con bendici√≥n. Porque es para esto que fueron llamados, para que reciban bendici√≥n.<br>[10] Pues: &quot;Cualquiera que quiere amar la vida y ver d√≠as buenos debe mantener su lengua fuera de maldad, y sus labios de hablar<br>[11] enga√±o, vu√©lvanse del mal y hagan el bien; busquen Shalom y corran detr√°s de El. <br>[12] Porque YAHWEH tiene sus ojos sobre el justo, y sus o√≠dos est√°n atentos a sus oraciones; pero el rostro de YAHWEH est√° contra aquellos que hacen cosas malvadas.&quot;<br><br> <br>Proverbios:8<br>[13] El temor a YAHWEH es odio a todo el mal. Yo odio el orgullo y la arrogancia, sendas malignas y duplicidad de lengua.<br><br> Deuteronomio:10<br> <br>[12] &quot;As√≠ que ahora, Yisra&#39;el, todo lo que YAHWEH su Elohim pide de ustedes es que teman a YAHWEH su Elohim, sigan sus caminos, que lo amen y sirvan a YAHWEH su Elohim con todo su coraz√≥n y con todo su ser;<br>[13] que le obedezcan, por el propio bien de ustedes, los mitzvot y regulaciones de YAHWEH que yo les estoy dando hoy.<br>[14] Miren, el firmamento, el cielo m√°s all√° del firmamento, la tierra y todo en ella todo pertenece a YAHWEH su Elohim.<br>[15] S√≥lo que YAHWEH tom√≥ suficiente placer en sus padres para amarlos y escogi√≥ a su zera despu√©s de ellos ‚Äì a ustedes ‚Äì por sobre todos los pueblos, como a√∫n El hace hoy.<br>[16] Por lo tanto, ¬°circunciden el prepucio de su coraz√≥n; y no sean m√°s de dura cerviz! <br>[17] Porque YAHWEH su Elohim es Elohim de dioses y Amo de se√±ores, el gran, poderoso e imponente Elohim, quien no tiene favoritos y no acepta sobornos.<br>[18] El asegura justicia para el hu√©rfano y la viuda; El ama al extranjero, d√°ndole comida y ropa. <br>[19] Por lo tanto ustedes amar√°n al extranjero, porque fueron extranjeros en la tierra de Mitzrayim. <br>[20] Ustedes temer√°n a YAHWEH su Elohim, le servir√°n, ag√°rrense de El y juren por Su Nombre.<br>[21] El es su alabanza, y El es su Elohim, que ha hecho por ustedes grandes e imponentes cosas, cuales ustedes han visto con sus propios ojos.<br>[22] Sus padres descendieron a Mitzrayim con s√≥lo setenta y cinco personas,  pero ahora ¬°YAHWEH su Elohim ha hecho sus n√∫meros tantos como las estrellas del firmamento!<br><br> Miqueas:6<br>[8] O hombre, ya se te ha dicho    lo que es bueno, lo que YAHWEH demanda de ti ‚Äì  no m√°s que act√∫es justamente, ames la misericordia  y est√©s listo para caminar con tu Elohim.<br>[9] ¬°La voz de YAHWEH ser√° proclamada en la ciudad!  Y El salvar√° a aquellos que temenSu Nombre.  &quot;O tribu, ¬øqui√©n ordenar√° la ciudad?<br>[10] ¬øNo hay fuego, y la casa del perverso llena de tesoros perversos?  ¬øY eso con el orgullo de la iniquidad?<br>[11] ¬øDeb√≠a Yo declarar inocente las balanzas perversas  y una bolsa de pesas fraudulentas?<br>[12] Ellos han acumulado su riqueza inicua,  los habitantes dicen mentiras,  con lenguas de enga√±o en sus bocas.<br>[13] &quot;Por lo tanto, comenzar√© a golpearte,  te destruirte en tus pecados.<br>[14] Comer√°s, pero no estar√°s satisfecho,  y habr√° oscuridad dentro de ti. Y El se ir√° de ti, y t√∫ no escapar√°s;  y los que escapen, ser√°n entregados a la espada.<br>[15] Plantar√°s, pero no cosechar√°s,  prensar√°s aceitunas, pero no te ungir√°s con aceite, har√°s vino, pero no beber√°s vino.   <br>[16] Porque t√∫ guardas los estatutos de Omri    y haces todas las obras de la casa de Ajav,  y has caminado en sus sendas.   que Yo pueda entregarte a total destrucci√≥n,  los habitantes de esta ciudad al siseo;  y cargar√°s con el reproche de las naciones.&quot;",0,0,Humilde

17007,FjU_x1106pg,"Judas:1<br> <br>[3] Queridos amigos: estaba ocupado trabajando escribi√©ndoles sobre la salvaci√≥n que compartimos, cuando encontr√© necesario escribirles alent√°ndolos a que se mantengan contendiendo arduamente por la fe que ha sido transmitida al pueblo de YAHWEH de una vez por todas.<br>[4] Porque ciertos individuos, de los que se ha escrito hace mucho tiempo que han sido destinados a condenaci√≥n, se han introducido solapadamente; gente perversa, pervierten la misericordia de YAHWEH en licencia para libertinaje y niegan a nuestro Unico Amo y Ad√≥n Yahsh√∫a Ha Mash√≠aj. <br>[5] Puesto que todos ya saben todo esto, mi prop√≥sito es s√≥lo recordarles que YAHWEH, quien una vez salv√≥ al pueblo sac√°ndolo de Mitzrayim, despu√©s destruy√≥ a los que no confiaron.<br>[6] Y a los malajim que no se mantuvieron dentro de Su autoridad original, sino que abandonaron su propia morada, El los ha guardado en oscuridad, atados con cadenas eternas  para el Juicio del Gran D√≠a.<br>[7] Y Sedom, Amorah y las ciudades vecinas, siguiendo un comportamiento como el de ellos, cometieron pecados sexuales y perversi√≥n; yacen expuestos como advertencia del fuego eterno que aguarda a aquellos que tendr√°n que sufrir el castigo. <br>[8] Asimismo, esta gente con sus visiones, profanan su propia carne, desprecian la autoridad divina e insultan seres malajim.<br>[9] Cuando Mijael, el malaj prominente, contend√≠a con ha sat√°n, disputando sobre el cuerpo de Moshe, no se atrevi√≥ hacerle juicio con acusaciones insultantes, sino dijo: &quot;Que YAHWEH te reprenda.&quot;<br>[10] Sin embargo, esta gente insulta cualquier cosa que ellos no entienden; y lo que s√≠ entienden naturalmente, sin pensar, como animales, ¬°por estas cosas son destruidos! <br>[11] ¬°Ay de ellos! Porque han seguido el camino de Kayin, y se han dado por lucro a s√≠ mismos al error de Bilaam y han sido destruidos en la rebeli√≥n de Koraj. <br>[12] Estos hombres son manchas asquerosas que en sus reuniones festivas dirigidas a promover el amor; comparten sus cenas con ustedes sin remordimiento mientras s√≥lo se complacen a s√≠ mismos. Son nubes sin agua llevadas por el viento; √°rboles sin fruto a√∫n en oto√±o, y doblemente muertos porque han sido desarraigados.<br>[13] Olas de mar salvaje que muestran sus obras vergonzosas como espuma; estrellas errantes, para las que est√° reservada la oscuridad m√°s negra para siempre.<br>[14] Adem√°s, Janoj, en la s√©ptima generaci√≥n desde Adam, tambi√©n profetiz√≥ diciendo: &quot;¬°Miren! YAHWEH vino con sus mir√≠adas de seres Kadoshim<br>[15] para ejecutar el juicio contra todos, esto es, para condenar toda la impiedad de los actos malvados que han hecho de una forma tan perversa, y de todas las palabras necias que estos pecadores imp√≠os han hablado contra El.&quot; <br>[16] Esta gente son murmuradores y quejumbrosos, siguen sus pasiones malvadas, sus bocas hablan grandiosidades, y adulan a otros para sacar provecho.<br>[17] Pero ustedes, queridos amigos, tengan en mente las palabras que se hablaron de antemano por los emisarios de nuestro Ad√≥n Yahsh√∫a Ha Mash√≠aj.<br>[18] Ellos dijeron: &quot;Durante el ajarit hayamim habr√° burladores que seguir√°n sus propias pasiones malvadas.&quot;<br>[19] Estas son las personas que causan divisiones. Est√°n controladas por sus impulsos porque no tienen el Ruaj.<br>[20] Pero ustedes, queridos amigos, edif√≠quense en su fe m√°s Kadoshim y oren en uni√≥n con el Ruaj HaKodesh,<br>[21] as√≠ manteni√©ndose en el amor de YAHWEH, mientras esperan por Yahsh√∫a Ha Mash√≠aj, quien da la misericordia que los lleva a la vida eterna.<br>[22] Reprendan a algunos que disputan;<br>[23] salven a otros, arrebat√°ndolos del fuego y a√∫n a otros, mostrando misericordia, pero con temor, odiando hasta la ropa manchada por sus vicios. <br>[24] Ahora, al que los puede guardar sin ca√≠da y presentarlos sin mancha y llenos de alegr√≠a en la presencia de su Shejinah,<br>[25] a YAHWEH, nuestro Salvador, por medio de Yahsh√∫a Ha Mash√≠aj, nuestro Ad√≥n; sea la Gloria, la Majestad, el Poder y la Autoridad antes de todos los tiempos, ahora y para siempre. Amein.<br> <br><br><br>Ezequiel:16<br>[49] Los pecados de tu hermana Sedom fueron soberbia y glotoner√≠a; ella y sus hijas fueron ociosas y complacientes de s√≠ mismas, as√≠ que no hicieron nada para ayudar al pobre y el menesteroso. <br>[50] Ellas fueron arrogantes y cometieron iniquidades delante de m√≠; as√≠ que cuando Yo los vi, los borr√© del mapa.<br>[51] Shomron no cometi√≥ ni la mitad de los pecados que t√∫ cometiste. T√∫ cometiste muchas m√°s iniquidades que tus hermanas; de hecho, ¬°en comparaci√≥n con todas las iniquidades que t√∫ has cometido, ellas parecen inocentes!<br><br> <br>2 Pedro:2<br> <br>[6] Y conden√≥ a las ciudades de Sedom y Amora, reduci√©ndolas a ceniza y escombros, como una advertencia para aquellos en el futuro que vivieran vidas imp√≠as;<br>[7] pero rescat√≥ a Lot, un hombre justo que estaba abrumado por el libertinaje an√°rquico de aquella gente sin principios;<br>[8] porque los actos malvados que este hombre vio y oy√≥, cuando viv√≠a entre ellos, atormentaban su justo coraz√≥n d√≠a a d√≠a.<br>[9] As√≠ que el Ad√≥n sabe rescatar a los Kadoshim de las pruebas y reservar a los malvados hasta el D√≠a del Juicio,  mientras contin√∫a castig√°ndolos,<br>[10] especialmente los que siguen a su vieja naturaleza en la lujuria de la podredumbre y desprecian la autoridad. Estos presuntuosos y obstinados falsos maestros no temen, insultando seres malajim,<br>[11] mientras que los malajim, que son m√°s fuertes y poderosos, no traen ante el Ad√≥n acusaciones insultantes contra ellos.<br>[12] Pero esta gente, actuando sin pensar, como bestias sin razonamiento,  nacidos para ser capturados y destruidos, insultan cosas acerca de las cuales no tienen ning√∫n conocimiento. Cuando sean destruidos, su destrucci√≥n ser√° total;<br>[13] recibir√°n da√±o en pago como salario por el da√±o que est√°n haciendo. Su idea de placer es estar de juerga a la plena luz del d√≠a; son manchas y defectos que se revelan en sus recepciones, mientras comparten una comida con ustedes;<br>[14] pues tienen ojos vigilantes para encontrar una mujer que cometa adulterio, ojos que nunca dejan de brillar, y tienen un coraz√≥n que se ejercita en la avaricia, por tanto seducen a la gente inestable. ¬°Que maldici√≥n est√°n empollando!<br>[15] Esta gente ha dejado el camino recto y se ha ido por el camino de Bilaam  Ben-Beor, que amaba las ganancias por hacer el mal;<br>[16] pero fue reprendido por su pecado; ¬°pues una bestia de carga que le habl√≥ con voz humana restringi√≥ la demencia del profeta!<br>[17] Ellos son fuentes sin agua, niebla empujada por r√°fagas de viento; para ellos est√° reservada la oscuridad m√°s densa.<br>[18] Bocones hablando grandiosidades de la nada, juegan con los deseos de la vieja naturaleza, para seducir con lujuria de la carne a la gente que ha empezado a escapar de aquellos cuyos caminos de vida son errados.<br>[19] Les prometen libertad, pero ellos mismos son esclavos de la corrupci√≥n; porque la persona se convierte en esclava de quien lo ha derrotado.<br>[20] En verdad, si ellos una vez escaparon de las contaminaciones del mundo por medio de conocer a nuestro Ad√≥n y Salvador Yahsh√∫a Ha Mash√≠aj, y se han enredado otra vez en ellas, y han sido derrotados, su condici√≥n ulterior ha llegado a ser peor que la primera.<br>[21] Hubiera sido mejor para ellos no haber conocido el camino de la justificaci√≥n, que conoci√©ndolo completamente, volverse del mandamiento Kadosh que les fue entregado. <br>[22] Lo que les ha pasado a ellos est√° en conformidad con el proverbio ver√≠dico: &quot;El perro regresa a su propio v√≥mito.&quot;  ¬°S√≠!, &quot;¬°La puerca se lava a s√≠ misma, s√≥lo para volver a revolcarse en el lodo!&quot; <br><br> <br>Jerem√≠as:23<br> <br>[14] Tambi√©n en los profetas de Yerushalayim  he visto cosas horribles, mientras comet√≠an adulterio.  y caminaron en mentiras, y fortalecieron las manos de muchos, que ellos no deb√≠an regresar de su camino perverso. Para m√≠ todos se han convertido como Sedom, sus habitantes como Amora.&quot; <br>[15] Por lo tanto, as√≠ dice YAHWEH-Tzevaot: &quot;Yo les dar√© agua de hiel a beber,  porque de los profetas de Yerushalayim la profanaci√≥n ha ido a toda La Tierra.&quot;<br>[16] As√≠ dice YAHWEH-Tzevaot: &quot;No escuchen las palabras de los profetas  porque ellos exponen una vana visi√≥n, ellos hablan de su propio coraz√≥n  y no de la boca de YAHWEH.<br>[17] Ellos dicen a los que rechazan la Palabra de YAHWEH:  &#39;Habr√° Shalom para ustedes, y para todos los que caminan tras sus propias lujurias,&#39; y para todos los que caminan en el error de sus corazones,  ellos dicen: &#39;Ning√∫n mal vendr√° sobre ti.&#39;<br>[18] Pero, ¬øqui√©n ha estado presente en el consejo de YAHWEH?  ¬øQui√©n ha escuchado y o√≠do?<br>[19] ¬°Contemplen! ¬°Hay un terremoto de YAHWEH, y la ira procede a convulsi√≥n, vendr√° violentamente sobre los perversos!<br>[20] La ira de YAHWEH no se aplacar√°, hasta que El cumpla completamente los deseos de su coraz√≥n. En el ajarit-hayamim, t√∫ comprender√°s todo.<br><br> <br>G√©nesis:19<br> <br>[24] Entonces La Palabra de   YAHWEH caus√≥ que lloviera azufre y fuego sobre Sedom y Amora de YAHWEH del cielo.<br>[25] El destruy√≥ esas ciudades, la planicie completa, todos los habitantes de las ciudades y todo lo que crec√≠a en la tierra.<br>[26] Pero su esposa detr√°s de √©l mir√≥ hacia atr√°s, y ella se convirti√≥ en una columna de sal.",0,0,Humilde

T√∫ cometiste muchas m√°s iniquidades que tus hermanas; de hecho, ¬°en comparaci√≥n con todas las iniquidades que t√∫ has cometido, ellas parecen inocentes!<br><br> <br>2 Pedro:2<br> <br>[6] Y conden√≥ a las ciudades de Sedom y Amora, reduci√©ndolas a ceniza y escombros, como una advertencia para aquellos en el futuro que vivieran vidas imp√≠as;<br>[7] pero rescat√≥ a Lot, un hombre justo que estaba abrumado por el libertinaje an√°rquico de aquella gente sin principios;<br>[8] porque los actos malvados que este hombre vio y oy√≥, cuando viv√≠a entre ellos, atormentaban su justo coraz√≥n d√≠a a d√≠a.<br>[9] As√≠ que el Ad√≥n sabe rescatar a los Kadoshim de las pruebas y reservar a los malvados hasta el D√≠a del Juicio,  mientras contin√∫a castig√°ndolos,<br>[10] especialmente los que siguen a su vieja naturaleza en la lujuria de la podredumbre y desprecian la autoridad. Estos presuntuosos y obstinados falsos maestros no temen, insultando seres malajim,<br>[11] mientras que los malajim, que son m√°s fuertes y poderosos, no traen ante el Ad√≥n acusaciones insultantes contra ellos.<br>[12] Pero esta gente, actuando sin pensar, como bestias sin razonamiento,  nacidos para ser capturados y destruidos, insultan cosas acerca de las cuales no tienen ning√∫n conocimiento.

Su idea de placer es estar de juerga a la plena luz del d√≠a; son manchas y defectos que se revelan en sus recepciones, mientras comparten una comida con ustedes;<br>[14] pues tienen ojos vigilantes para encontrar una mujer que cometa adulterio, ojos que nunca dejan de brillar, y tienen un coraz√≥n que se ejercita en la avaricia, por tanto seducen a la gente inestable. ¬°Que maldici√≥n est√°n empollando!<br>[15] Esta gente ha dejado el camino recto y se ha ido por el camino de Bilaam  Ben-Beor, que amaba las ganancias por hacer el mal;<br>[16] pero fue reprendido por su pecado; ¬°pues una bestia de carga que le habl√≥ con voz humana restringi√≥ la demencia del profeta!<br>[17] Ellos son fuentes sin agua, niebla empujada por r√°fagas de viento; para ellos est√° reservada la oscuridad m√°s densa.<br>[18] Bocones hablando grandiosidades de la nada, juegan con los deseos de la vieja naturaleza, para seducir con lujuria de la carne a la gente que ha empezado a escapar de aquellos cuyos caminos de vida son errados.<br>[19] Les prometen libertad, pero ellos mismos son esclavos de la corrupci√≥n; porque la persona se convierte en esclava de quien lo ha derrotado.<br>[20] En verdad, si ellos una vez escaparon de las contaminaciones del mundo por medio de conocer a nuestro Ad√≥n y Salvador Yahsh√∫a Ha Mash√≠aj, y se han enredado otra vez en ellas, y han sido derrotados, su condici√≥n ulterior ha llegado a ser peor que la primera.<br>[21] Hubiera sido mejor para ellos no haber conocido el camino de la justificaci√≥n, que conoci√©ndolo completamente, volverse del mandamiento Kadosh que les fue entregado. <br>[22] Lo que les ha pasado a ellos est√° en conformidad con el proverbio ver√≠dico: &quot;El perro regresa a su propio v√≥mito.&quot;  ¬°S√≠!, &quot;¬°La puerca se lava a s√≠ misma, s√≥lo para volver a revolcarse en el lodo!&quot; <br><br> <br>Jerem√≠as:23<br> <br>[14] Tambi√©n en los profetas de Yerushalayim  he visto cosas horribles, mientras comet√≠an adulterio.  y caminaron en mentiras, y fortalecieron las manos de muchos, que ellos no deb√≠an regresar de su camino perverso. Para m√≠ todos se han convertido como Sedom, sus habitantes como Amora.&quot; <br>[15] Por lo tanto, as√≠ dice YAHWEH-Tzevaot: &quot;Yo les dar√© agua de hiel a beber,  porque de los profetas de Yerushalayim la profanaci√≥n ha ido a toda La Tierra.&quot;<br>[16] As√≠ dice YAHWEH-Tzevaot: &quot;No escuchen las palabras de los profetas  porque ellos exponen una vana visi√≥n, ellos hablan de su propio coraz√≥n  y no de la boca de YAHWEH.<br>[17] Ellos dicen a los que rechazan la Palabra de YAHWEH:  &#39;Habr√° Shalom para ustedes, y para todos los que caminan tras sus propias lujurias,&#39; y para todos los que caminan en el error de sus corazones,  ellos dicen: &#39;Ning√∫n mal vendr√° sobre ti.&#39;<br>[18] Pero, ¬øqui√©n ha estado presente en el consejo de YAHWEH?  ¬øQui√©n ha escuchado y o√≠do?<br>[19] ¬°Contemplen! ¬°Hay un terremoto de YAHWEH, y la ira procede a convulsi√≥n, vendr√° violentamente sobre los perversos!<br>[20] La ira de YAHWEH no se aplacar√°, hasta que El cumpla completamente los deseos de su coraz√≥n.

17085,FjU_x1106pg,"Hebreos:11<br> <br>[1] La confianza  es tener la certeza de lo que esperamos esperanzados, convencidos acerca de las cosas que no vemos.<br>[2] Por esto La Escritura da testimonio del m√©rito de los ancianos  . <br>[3] Por la confianza entendemos que el Universo fue creado por la Palabra hablada de YAHWEH,  as√≠ que, lo que se ve no vino a existir de un fen√≥meno existente .<br>[4] Por la confianza Hevel ofreci√≥ mayor sacrificio que Kayin, y por esto fue declarado justificado, dando YAHWEH testimonio a El sobre la base de sus ofrendas, por medio de haber confiado; todav√≠a contin√∫a hablando, aunque est√° muerto.<br>[5] Por la confianza Janoj fue arrebatado de esta vida sin ver la muerte; &quot;El no fue encontrado porque YAHWEH lo traslad√≥,&quot; pues tuvo el testimonio, antes de ser trasladado, de haber sido de muy placentero a YAHWEH.<br>[6] Y sin tener confianza es imposible ser muy placentero a YAHWEH, porque cualquiera que se acerque a El tiene que tener la confianza de que en realidad El existe y que El es el dador de la recompensa a aquellos que le buscan.<br>[7] Por la confianza Noaj, despu√©s de recibir advertencia Divina acerca de cosas que todav√≠a no se ve√≠an, fue lleno de temor Kadosh e hizo un Arca para salvar a los de su casa. Por medio de esta confianza, puso al mundo bajo condenaci√≥n, y recibi√≥ la justificaci√≥n que viene por medio de la confianza.<br>[8] Por la confianza Avraham obedeci√≥ despu√©s de que fue llamado a salir  al lugar que YAHWEH le dar√≠a como posesi√≥n; en verdad, sali√≥ sin saber adonde iba.<br>[9] Por la confianza vivi√≥ como residente temporal en La Tierra de la promesa, como si no fuera de √©l, viviendo en tiendas con Yitzjak y Yaakov, quienes iban a recibir lo que hab√≠a sido prometido a √©l. <br>[10] Porque estaba aguardando esperanzado la ciudad que tiene fundamentos permanentes, de la cual el arquitecto y constructor es YAHWEH.<br>[11] Por la confianza √©l recibi√≥ potencia para engendrar un hijo, aunque su edad para eso ya le hab√≠a pasado, y as√≠ tambi√©n estaba la misma Sarah; porque crey√≥ que el que lo hab√≠a prometido era digno de confianza.<br>[12] Por lo cual, este hombre que estaba virtualmente muerto engendr√≥ zera, tan numerosos como las estrellas del firmamento, e incontables como los gramos de arena en la orilla del mar.<br>[13] Todas estas personas permanecieron confiando hasta que murieron, sin recibir lo que hab√≠a sido prometido. Ellos s√≥lo lo hab√≠an visto y recibido desde la distancia, mientras reconoc√≠an que ellos eran extranjeros y residentes temporales en la tierra.<br>[14] Porque personas que hablan de esta forma, claramente dan a entender que buscan una patria.<br>[15] Ahora bien, si hubieran estado record√°ndose de d√≥nde salieron, ten√≠an una oportunidad para regresar, <br>[16] pero como es, aspiraban a tener mejor patria, una celestial. Por esto YAHWEH no se averg√ºenza de ser llamado Elohim de ellos; porque les ha preparado una ciudad.<br>[17] Por la confianza Avraham, cuando fue puesto a prueba, ofreci√≥ a Yitzjak como sacrificio. S√≠, √©l ofreci√≥ a su √∫nico hijo, el que hab√≠a recibido la promesa,<br>[18] a quien le fue dicho: &quot;Lo que es llamado tu zera ser√° en Yizjak.&quot;<br>[19] ¬°Porque ya hab√≠a cre√≠do hasta que YAHWEH pod√≠a resucitar a los muertos! Y figuradamente, √©l as√≠ lo recibi√≥. <br>[20] Por la confianza Yitzjak, en su bendici√≥n sobre Yaakov y Esav hizo referencia a los eventos por venir.<br>[21] Por la confianza Ya&#39;akov, cuando estaba muriendo, bendijo a cada uno de los hijos de Yosef, y apoy√°ndose en su bast√≥n se inclin√≥ reverentemente en oraci√≥n.<br>[22] Por la confianza Yosef, cerca del t√©rmino de su vida, se record√≥ del √©xodo del pueblo de Yisra&#39;el, y dio instrucciones sobre qu√© hacer con sus huesos.<br>[23] Por la confianza los padres de Moshe le escondieron por tres meses despu√©s que naci√≥, porque vieron que era un ni√±o hermoso,  y no ten√≠an temor del decreto del rey.<br>[24] Por la confianza Moshe, despu√©s que hab√≠a crecido,  rehus√≥ ser llamado hijo de la hija de Fara√≥n.<br>[25] Escogi√≥ ser maltratado junto con el pueblo de YAHWEH antes que disfrutar de los placeres temporales del pecado.<br>[26] Hab√≠a llegado a escoger los abusos sufridos por el Mash√≠aj como riquezas mayores que los tesoros de Egipto, porque hab√≠a puesto sus ojos en la recompensa.<br>[27] Por la confianza √©l se fue de Egipto sin tener miedo a la ira del rey; persever√≥ como uno que ve lo invisible.<br>[28] Por la confianza obedeci√≥ los requerimientos de P√©saj, incluyendo la aspersi√≥n de la sangre, para que el Destructor de los primog√©nitos no tocara a los primog√©nitos de Yisra&#39;el.<br>[29] Por la confianza ellos caminaron a trav√©s del Mar Rojo como si por tierra seca, y cuando los Egipcios trataron de hacerlo el mar se los trag√≥.<br>[30] Por la confianza los muros de Yerijo se derrumbaron despu√©s que el pueblo march√≥ alrededor de ellos por siete d√≠as.<br>[31] Por la confianza Rajav la prostituta, dio la bienvenida a los esp√≠as y, por tanto, no muri√≥ con aquellos que fueron desobedientes<br>[32] ¬øQu√© m√°s podr√≠a decir? No hay tiempo para contar de Gideon, Barak, Shimshon, Yiftaj, David, Shemuel y todos los profetas;<br>[33] quienes por medio de la confianza conquistaron reinos, hicieron justicia, recibieron lo que estaba prometido, cerraron bocas de leones,<br>[34] apagaron el poder del fuego, escaparon al filo de la espada, tuvieron sus debilidades convertidas en fortaleza, fueron poderosos en batalla, pusieron en fuga a ej√©rcitos extranjeros.<br>[35] Las mujeres recibieron sus muertos mediante resurrecci√≥n; otros fueron torturados, no aceptando el rescate a fin de obtener una mejor resurrecci√≥n.<br>[36] Otros experimentaron pruebas de ser vituperados y azotados, encadenados y echados en prisi√≥n.<br>[37] Fueron apedreados, aserrados al medio, asesinados a filo de espada; anduvieron de ac√° para all√° cubiertos de pieles de ovejas y de cabras, pobres, perseguidos y maltratados,<br>[38] ¬°errantes en desiertos y montes, viviendo en cuevas y en huecos en la tierra! ¬°El mundo no era digno de ellos! <br>[39] Todos √©stos, tuvieron su m√©rito confirmado por la confianza, pero a pesar de eso, no recibieron lo que hab√≠a sido prometido,<br>[40] porque YAHWEH hab√≠a planeado algo mejor que nos implicar√≠a a todos nosotros, para que s√≥lo con nosotros pudieran ser llevados a la meta.<br><br>Santiago:2<br> <br>[14] ¬øDe qu√© sirve, mis hermanos, si alguno asegura que tiene fe, pero no tiene obras? ¬øPodr√° esta &quot;tal fe&quot; salvarle?<br>[15] Supongan que un hermano o hermana est√° sin ropa y sin comida para el diario,<br>[16] y alguno le dice: &quot;¬°Shalom! ¬°Mantente abrigado y come hasta saciarte!,&quot; sin darle lo que necesita. ¬øDe qu√© le sirve?<br>[17] As√≠ que, la fe sola, si no est√° acompa√±ada con obras, est√° muerta. <br>[18] Pero alguien dir√°: ¬°T√∫ tienes fe y yo tengo obras, mu√©strame esta fe tuya sin las obras, y yo te mostrar√© mi fe por mis obras!<br><br>G√°latas:2<br> <br>[19] Pues fue dejando que la Tor√°h hablara por s√≠ sola que yo mor√≠ a las tradicionales malas interpretaciones legalistas, para que as√≠ pudiera vivir en relaci√≥n directa con YAHWEH. <br>[20] Cuando el Mash√≠aj fue ejecutado en la estaca como un criminal, yo tambi√©n lo fui; as√≠ que mi soberbio ego ya no vive. Pero el Mash√≠aj vive en m√≠, y la vida que ahora vivo en el cuerpo, la vivo por la misma confianza en la llenura de fe que ten√≠a el Hijo de YAHWEH, el cual me am√≥ y muri√≥ por m√≠.<br>[21] Yo no rechazo el don de la misericordia de YAHWEH; pero si de la manera que uno obtiene justificaci√≥n es por medio de legalismos  , entonces la muerte del Mash√≠aj no tiene ning√∫n sentido.",0,0,Humilde

17818,biTBwhoa4gM,"Hola Erik, soy hispano-parlante y aqu√≠ est√°n los subt√≠tulos de tu video para los estudiantes de ingl√©s:<br>Hi Erik, I&#39;m spanish speaker and here&#39;s the subtitles of your video for students who are learning english:<br>No matter how many times you have been at to New York. The city can always overwhelm you with a crazy amount of things to experience.  yeah so I&#39;ve already covered what not to do in New York in a previous video and I&#39;ve teamed up with Google who&#39;s sponsoring today&#39;s video. Using the Chromebook to take on the challenge of sharing with you my comprehensive expert list of what TO DO in New York City! Number one on my list is...<br><br>Free movie night in Bryant Park<br>Bryant park is located here on West 41st St and 6th avenue right next to Time Square. Every Monday during the summer, starting in about June through late August, a movie plays under the bright lights of the city in Bryant Park. There‚Äôs this nostalgic atmosphere here and people from all over the city and the world is coming out to enjoy an old-fashioned film in the middle of the city for free. The lawn opens up at 5 p.m. and at  the website advises you to arrive early, which you should 100% do if you want to get a spot on the lawn. It fills up fast and it&#39;s a first-come-first-serve basis. If you&#39;re hungry there are food vendors on the fountain terrace with tons of meal options, all this information can be found on the Bryant Park website along with a list of the films playing for the entire summer. There is nothing like seeing a film on the big screen with New York City as your backdrop.<br><br>Support Local Restaurants<br>Now this is a bold claim but I truly believe that the number one way to find anything while traveling in 2018 is by Instagram. When I arrive in a new city I go on Instagram and check out the location tag of specific places around the city I want to explore. I browse through the top photos to gain some inspiration or ideas on places to see and of course places to eat. When in New York you want to eat at local establishments, you know places with character. This is one of my go-to coffee spots in the city right by Washington Square Park. It was opened in 1927 and the Italian cappuccino was actually introduced to America by the founder of this Cafe. Almost a century later and it still has that old school New York Jazz vibe. The perfect place to come in early, get some work done and of course had the original cappuccino. Basically anywhere that is not a chain restaurant is the way to go.<br><br>Rent a bike<br>So I&#39;m a bit biased but my favorite way to see the any new city is by bike and New York is no exception, now if you don&#39;t own a bike that&#39;s no problem. There is Rideshare bike stations on almost every block in New York.  Now the streets in New York are hectic even with the designated by claims, that&#39;s why I recommend heading over to the West Side Highway bike path. It runs the whole west side of Manhattan along the Hudson River, you can bike or run here without having to worry about traffic. There is also some the best views in entire city over here at Pier 63 and the next activity on my list which is a boat tour around Manhattan. . <br><br>Sunset boat tour<br>By far, one of the best ways to see unparalleled views of Manhattan is from the water on the Hudson River. You have a few options for ways to get out on the water. You can pay the $30 for a New York waterways site tour, for the thrill seeker and a bit more money you can rent some jet skis, then there&#39;s the Staten Island Ferry for $4.86, you can rent or book a sailboat tour or you can round up some friends and throw a party on a yacht.<br><br>I recommend going at Golden hour you know right around Sunset with those views it is the perfect Instagram shot. You can even pop your photos right in the lightroom on the boat and edit and post in real time.<br><br>The boat that I took left from Chelsea Piers, we made our way down to the Statue of Liberty and I&#39;m talkin right up close to Lady Liberty with Incredible views of One World Trade Center and Lower Manhattan. Right as those city lights start to sparkle, then we made our way back up the river with iconic shots of the Empire State Building and the midtown skyline. If you want those views I highly recommend a boat tour but if you&#39;re into boat rides that are let&#39;s just say a bit more laid back then I recommend heading up to Central Park  to the paddle boats.<br><br>Central park row boats<br>Now, Central Park is massive. It was established in 1857. My pro tip is to drop a pin on Google Maps at locations in the part that you want to revisit just because it is so massive and it&#39;s easy to get lost. <br><br>This is definitely one of the more romantic things to do in the city. Now you can rent a boat from 10 a.m. until about sundown. For my biggest piece of advice is get here early as the day goes on this place gets packed. It&#39;s a cash-only operation, it costs $15 per hour with a $20 cash deposit.<br><br>You can hear some soft jazz often a distance, beautiful summer day, this is one of my favorite things to do that I actually don&#39;t do enough. There is nothing more unique than being in the middle of the city on the lake with no people around, I mean just look at this view, come here to decompress, to dish stress from the hectic hustle and bustle of midtown, enjoy some fresh air surrounded by nature and of course, hear some incredible live jazz music.<br><br>Off-off Broadway show<br>So don‚Äôt get wrong, Broadway shows are absolutely amazing. I love ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù just as much as ‚ÄúThe next guy‚Äù but my pro tip is get off Broadway and see some of off off Broadway plays in the city. Fun fact, when I first moved to the city I actually had an internship at the actor studio in Hell&#39;s Kitchen so you know, there‚Äôs tons a lot of theaters all around the city.<br><br>Off off Broadway shows are less expensive, a cozy intimate environment and many times more entertaining and authentic than a big-budget show. If you‚Äôre unsure what show to see off Broadway you can always check to see what shows are selling discounted tickets through the tickets app. And as an alternative to check near play, go to a stand-up comedy show at one of my favorite spots in the whole city is the Gotham Comedy Club, there&#39;s nothing like seeing a live show in the city.<br><br>The Manhattanhenge<br>It‚Äôs safe to say that the most photogenic days are during the summer in NYC. Four times a year, the sun aligns perfectly with Manhattan&#39;s East West grid creating the Manhattanhenge coined by Neil deGrasse Tyson as an ode to Stonehenge. <br><br>The reason that the Manhattanhenge is so rare is the fact that you have to have perfectly clear skies on a night like tonight, to get the sun to set right down there in between the streets of Manhattan. The best places to view the Manhattanhenge are on 14th, 23th, 42nd, and 57th street. <br><br>Two hundreds years ago, the architects who created the plan for modern Manhattan decided to use a grid system with avenues that run north to south and streets east to west and that choice set the stage before the Manhattanhenge to occur.<br><br>I&#39;m curious comment down below your top things to do in New York City make sure to subscribe for more high quality NYC content and with that I will see you in the next one.",1,0,Aleks Salda√±a

17863,biTBwhoa4gM,"Born and raised New Yorker here, and gotta agree with a lot of the video. Just... Off-off Broadway is a bit of a hit or miss. Some GREAT stuff and then every so often something&#39;ll just make you wanna leave halfway through the show. Also, the farther you get away from Times Square, the cheaper the pizza is. Do not get pizza in Times Square. There&#39;s like a S&#39;barros and then nothing decent. But if you&#39;re in Times Square, pick up a cupcake at Carlo&#39;s Bakery, they&#39;ve got GOOD CUPCAKES. As for the Staten Island Ferry, lately a lot of people have been coming in to Staten Island and then just turning around and leaving because this borough did a VERY POOR JOB of advertising what it&#39;s got. The Boardwalk has some amazing views of NYC from a distance if you want some of those shots, there&#39;s a &#39;town&#39; of buildings from the 1600&#39;s, a similarly old graveyard if you like the spoopy stuff, and if you like smaller and not a billion people around you museums, there&#39;s a museum of Tibetan art.",4,3,Cally's Paint Stuff

18461,JwMefsNZ77U,"A good guide video! Personally, I always prefer to go via Howard Beach. Way less chaotic, but it sort of depends where in NYC you want to go (and no LIRR option this way). Just a minor note: the Airtrain fare increase actually happened on November 1, 2019, so not pandemic inflation related. I only know this because I flew out on October 31st and it was $5, and returning on November 3rd, it was $7.75!",10,1,Greg Overberg

18464,JwMefsNZ77U,"Just to point out, you would very rarely need to wait 30 minutes from Jamaica to Penn Station.  Going to destinations on Long Island (and other stations) you might need to wait 30 minutes or so if you just miss a train, but multiple train lines go from Jamaica to Penn Station, so it is rarely a wait of more than 15 minutes or so, even outside of rush hour (late at night could be a bit loner)",2,1,Tim J
18465,JwMefsNZ77U,"This was really helpful, thanks for making it! When taking the path you did, AirTrain -&gt; LIRR, roughly how long did the whole journey take? I have a Global Entry interview at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMefsNZ77U&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> in JFK in a while.

18479,JwMefsNZ77U,"Great info.

You can go to Manhattan in 2.75$ via Q10 bus from jfk terminal 4 and free transfer to subway at Union turnpike / kew gardens station where you get E and F train .You need to have money on metro card to get free transfer or if bus driver provides you with paper ticket for transfer.

18515,JwMefsNZ77U,"Great video.  Just a few notes from a native<br><br>1) the Sim Cards in the airport are knockoff garbage.  If you buy one and it doesn&#39;t work you will not get a refund<br><br>2) you can use the same MetroCard on the AirTrain and Subway as long as it&#39;s a Pay-per-ride card and not unlimited.  You&#39;ll actually get a free transfer from Air Train to Subway as it&#39;ll detect the swipe in your card.  Thus you would only pay the 7.75 total<br><br>3) if you are visiting anywhere near mid-town it&#39;s going to be a lot faster to take the LIRR, even if it&#39;s Times Square.  Right as you exit the LIRR you can immediately transfer for the subway or walk.  The subway will take you a lot longer<br><br>4) UBER does not have a special NYC rate.  They will charge you around $30-$40 to go from JFK to Manhattan. (The hustlers will charge you upwards of $100 but that&#39;s a whole other story)<br><br>Overall though, your video was great and informative",2,2,Matt Seifman

18525,JwMefsNZ77U,"A few notes about this from a Native New Yorker who lives in Queens, not too far from the LIRR in Jamaica.  The LIRR  is nicer, more upscale than the Subway, butg obvkiously more expensive.  The LIRR Cars also have bathrooms  (NO Showers) but Toilets, maybe not the Cleanest which NYC Subway Cars don&#39;t have.  I think during the Pandemic they got rid of the BAthrooms in NYC Subway Staions which defintely were not the NIcest.<br>  If you take the Subway form Jaimaica since it is one of the first Stops, you should be able to  get a Seat on the E Train. Another option maybe Renata will cover this later is to take the Q60 Bus near the LIRR Jamaica Terminal  which ends go along Queens Blvd and  end up stopping in Manhattan as the last stop by the 59th Street Bridge really 60th Street and 2nde Avenue.  The Q60  would be a long ride during the day especially Rush Hour into Manhattan- defintely  over a hour, more like 90 MInutes, shorter at Night.  The  Q60 Bus takes the Metro CArd like the Subways and I believe the New Omni Card MTA is beginning to use to repalce the Metro Card.  I am old fashioned and prefer the Metro Card.<br>  I beleive one can take other  MTA Buses like the Q10  to go to and from JFK as well which should requre  a regular MTA FAre unlike the AirTrain which now I see is $7.75 as opposed to the Bus which is $2.75 and you get one free transfer either to the Subway or another bus as long as you use it within 3 hours  (I think the transfer period was 2 hours when this first began a number of years ago, but I heard it is 3 hours now)",1,2,HoldenNY22
